- intent: Adaptation
  examples:
  - You mean like that?
  - But with the unobstructed, lets see, its moving away from that object that energy.
  - Yeah, but that energy doesnt go away.
  - But it stops, and then it doesnt come back.
  - But isnt it like that moving thing stays the same all the time on that unbroken track?
  - Yeah, it stays, it stays.
  - Yeah, well, if theres a lot of bitterness, then the moving guns gonna go off.
  - Yeah, what were you saying?
  - The energy wont go away, but...
  - When its not like...
  - Yes, I did.
  - The energy that even if...
  - Energy, on a straight line, energy doesnt move from skater to earth.
  - Ill ride it.
  - In the air.
  - It keeps that momentum going all the time.
  - So its gonna replace that business and...
  - Well, with that potential energy that goes with it, youre gonna...
  - Its not gonna change.
  - Well, the energy changes shape all the time.
  - Well, its not going to go away.
  - The power wont go out.
  - Law of Energy Conservation
  - Its new.
  - But its not the skater. Its the skateboard.
  - Well, its not a skater, its a dog.
  - No gravity when you mass.
  - Even at that point.
  - Not when it was exactly that whole energy.
  - Its a different question about how the mass of a skater affects the energies, and the answer is yes, and then what can you say about total energy?
  - Well, in principle, should we put... separate that... look, if it has a large mass, then its like the kinetic energy is large, but the potential energy is small.
  - But both of them grow if the mass changes.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Yeah, well, yeah, well, they all grow up.
  - Put a little less on it.
  - If we can just put it in half.
  - Thats when its the heat energy.
  - Just like...
  - ...or disappeared recently.
  - There you go.
  - Hey, dont be so confused...
  - But theres more to it than that.
  - ...because then it scares the guys again.
  - We were completely understood.
  - You didnt ask me anything about the heat, did you? Why did we think of it?
  - Heat energy.
  - Where did they talk?
  - Well, it wasnt...
  - That wasnt what happens to the energies.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Lose some weight.
  - ...but there is no shovel.
  - No, its not a knife.
  - Or does that mean...
  - No, its just how it changes so that its really hard down there and it always changes...
  - ...that its like its going to be quiet when it goes up there.
  - That the speed changes that way.
  - ...and then they ask, not why...
  - ...that doesnt change, so theres no need to justify it.
  - This is all for nothing.
  - Yeah, but when it says it doesnt give direct answers, it does help.
  - Or is it the same thing?
  - Im not the one.
  - I... I think its the same.
  - It would be a lot different if it were necessary.
  - I know.
  - Its not about kinetic energy.
  - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
  - Im not.
  - Okay, I cant put it down, but theres one conclusion.
  - Yes, I did.
  - ♪ Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪
  - Yeah, but...
  - And then when youre done...
  - Move the mass.
  - No, Im not.
  - It doesnt say how the speed of a skater changes.
  - Well, yeah, but then its a two-way tie, not one, and put the skater on the ramp,
  - First, set a small value to the mass of the skater and then gradually increase it.
  - It didnt ask about the speed,
  - So we dont have to write about it.
  - Can you move it?
  - It says here...
  - So wheres the ramp?
  - So where the ramp, at the bottom
  - Well, because...
  - I mean, the total energy.
  - Its at its maximum. Its...
  - Because thats a little bit like a plus minus zero or something.
  - Its always the same.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Its the same thing all the time, but its changing, its changing.
  - Well, itll probably turn into potential energy then.
  - I guess it won t go away.
  - Yeah, it just changes its shape.
  - No total energy-- hey, the rooftop, the total energy stays the same.
  - Isnt that right?
  - Its like, when these energies change, but the total energy kind of stays the same all the time.
  - I know.
  - Yes, I did.
  - It just seems faster when its somehow...
  - Yes, I did.
  - Its got to be somehow.
  - I could put a line underneath it and then I could put the arrows.
  - I saw this.
  - ...it just looks like its so different in size.
  - Thats what it looks like.
  - So, yes, it takes the same amount of time, but the energy is still bigger than what moves there when its bigger.
  - Keep it small.
  - No, its the same speed.
  - Yeah, its the same thing.
  - It may not be connected in the sense that its a country if its meant to be for
    some students.
  - So you can use it.
  - So that it doesnt give you direct answers.
  - No, its talking to itself out there, but its very quiet.
  - I dont think we should go any faster than that.
  - Yes, it was.
  - Can you slowly turn that mass into that...
  - You know, I...
  - Lets try it.
  - Im going to be a little bit.
  - Im sure you can put a picture of him in there.
  - You make a U-letter or a tommosis and then you put it there and there.
  - Im not going to.
  - So you didnt come all the time.
  - But if it stays the same, the heat energy increases, and for some people, it has
    to decrease.
  - Yeah, and then they both shrink because of it.
  - Okay, so we had to raise that pile every time...
  - ...a small amount and then gradually increase it.
  - Okay, lets try a little bigger...
  - ...and then we can probably answer.
  - Thats 30 people.
  - Or like everything stays the same.
  - Its all the same.
  - Yes, I did.
  - That its nothing, because its not bitter, I guess.
  - No, we, you just need to write one conclusion...
  - ...aa, for each simulation of three questions
  - I know.
  - Yeah, but its just that, the speed of the skater is small up there and the maximum
    down there.
  - I mean, I did.
  - Yes, if we are.
  - Yes, it is. It is, and not with the crowd.
  - And its not just because the Earths gravity is there.
  - Yeah, well, yeah, thats what its all about, but if theres no gravity at all,
    its just gonna stay afloat.
  - If nothing pulled the cat to the ground, it would stay in place all the time or
    float.
  - If it gets energy in one direction, then it just goes away... or if its gone
    in one direction, it just goes there endlessly.
  - ♪ Say, youre the answer ♪ ♪ Ill do whatever it takes ♪
  - Thats the attraction.
  - Gravity
  - The gravity.
  - Yeah, well, yeah, it is.
  - So that gravity affects it for a long time, all the time.
  - Yeah, well, I know.
  - And then, but its the same principle as when it goes up.
  - Yeah, full time goes further.
  - Yeah, it pulls back.
  - Yeah, it pulls back all the time.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Oh, yeah, the potential energy, it changes.
  - Its always changing over there.
  - It doesnt matter whats right, even if it goes wrong.
  - Im sure you do.
  - This is not a good thing for us.
  - Im sure it will.
  - Im sure, because it would slow the bit.
  - Because if its not itchy, its moving all the time.
  - The speed doesnt change because theres no bitterness.
  - I thought that MAI would be a sign that it would give us a chance to participate
    in the discussion.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Yes, I did.
  - But it doesnt even answer questions.
  - When it asks us questions.
  - Thats what they say.
- intent: Monitoring
  examples:
  - Are these the same questions?
  - Its in the visor.
  - We ll get back to you.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Is it these lines that we need to look at first?
  - Before you start working, first of all, check the selections in the introduction
    to the simulation.
  - What happened? What happened?
  - Now its back to zero.
  - Now its going the same way.
  - What else is in that?
  - The person, then the gravity.
  - What did you add?
  - Its the gravity.
  - The gravity...
  - ...and its going faster.
  - What happened there,
  - If you put that energy on the left?
  - Does it always go up there a little faster?
  - Wouldnt you like to see it?
  - No, its not that.
  - I dont know, I dont know.
  - This is interesting.
  - What were the questions again?
  - Whats the red energy?
  - I cant figure it out.
  - Is it heat?
  - Looks like it could be. 
  - Im not entirely sure.
  - How come it grows?
  - Was some friction still left somewhere there?
  - Shouldnt there be?
  - I just pulled it to zero.
  - Okay, I guess there was some left over.
  - There was a little bit, yeah.
  - It shouldnt, in principle, rise if there is no friction.
  - What was the second question?
  - Mm, you already answered that.
  - Where? - Where?
  - What is this? What is this?
  - Oh, nothing at all.
  - Nice, nice. I know.
  - Is that mission one?
  - Yeah, that was...
  - ...this is it.
  - What was that?
  - What, all of a sudden?
  - The night...
  - Well, can we answer the question now?
  - What was the first one?
  - What did you say?
  - Yeah, thats the next one.
  - At the bottom?
  - Oh, what?
  - There was a second point.
  - Isnt that just a second of the day?
  - Yeah, nothing to worry about.
  - Changes... why?
  - Lets take another look.
  - Mm. That triangle, yeah.
  - So, thats the third one.
  - Why cant you see the clock anywhere?
  - In class?
  - Or when it was set aside for this, those particular times.
  - So, this is ready now, isnt it?
  - Theres nothing on the other side anymore.
  - I know.
  - I know.
  - So the questions arent the same as those in there.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Theyre the same as that piece of paper.
  - Oh, is that right?
  - I know.
  - I can t see.
  - Wait, Im having a pretty bad day.
  - Yeah, there it is.
  - Did it matter which way?
  - No, but is it worth a little bit?
  - It can be legalized later in the mass.
  - And then we have to watch
  - how the mass of the skater affects the energies
  - Should we write this down?
  - Well, wait a minute.
  - Well, wait, lets get it on.
  - If it goes...
  - Its not going to stay the same?
  - Thats what it is, right?
  - I know.
  - Why is it the same?
  - Can you read those texts?
  - Yeah, business and energy.
  - So you dont have any potential?
  - I know the answer.
  - Youre saying that if you lose, you dont lose.
  - If its bitter, you lose.
  - Isnt it good that that energy changes shape?
  - Lets see if you can get a kick out of it.
  - It cant be destroyed.
  - Is that right?
  - Youre not?
  - Thats the idea there, but if he says
  - So, what does it say?
  - But how do you declare it...
  - Black feels like were overthinking
  - Yes, it is.
  - ♪ Oh, the unstoppable one ♪
  - Don t change the force of gravity.
  - What?
  - Why are you changing power?
  - Oh, my God.
  - Im sorry about that.
  - What? - What?
  - A bite?
  - Whats the point?
  - Is that it?
  - Because isnt that bitterness the opposite force to that movement?
  - Should we ever use that AI?
  - What do you want to throw at him?
  - Im just thinking about it.
  - I mean, like, like, anything.
  - Oh, you turned that dog.
  - Well, why not?
  - Okay, next.
  - I know.
  - This is the hard part.
  - Oh, the potential.
  - Or that bottom, what is it?
  - I know.
  - Isnt that enough?
  - When they put a spear in here
  - I mean, its just that...
  - I think that is also what we are looking for now, that energy, it is not as if
    it is now so called faster in real time.
  - So its not getting more of that energy, its the same energy.
  - How much was it supposed to cost?
  - Hey, whats that say?
  - But what happens to the skateboarder?
  - Movements and 
  - I wonder what Im touching.
  - If we were so smart that the AI industry wouldn t be helping us.
  - Shouldnt it start like this?
  - Well, I guess we need something like that.
  - I mean, should we initiate it?
  - Now we have to go to the bouncing balls, I guess.
  - I dont know, were not measuring the energy right now.
  - Or should we just look at the fact that...
  - No, its just... the energy, yeah.
  - So what were we supposed to be looking at?
  - But the old mans still growing.
  - But the energy is growing.
  - So we werent exactly marked for it.
  - I put it on the accelerator.
  - I put that speed in the same place, but then some energy goes up.
  - You mean, growing up?
  - But is it the same down here?
  - Its the same thing.
  - Ill have you on camera.
  - Thats what I wrote here.
  - Thats it.
  - Its five minutes old.
  - Whats the matter?
  - Yes, I did.
  - So, again, the same sentence.
  - Are there different missions?
  - What was the first question?
  - Whats going on in there?
  - I dont know. Someone put us in IGDM.
  - I mean, do we have to use the MAI too?
  - Well, I guess we wouldnt if we didnt need it.
  - No, not if we dont have anything to ask him.
  - Whats this? Whats this?
  - Well, it would seem that if its smaller, its moving faster, right?
  - But its not really moving in the nose.
  - But, you know, I guess thats the speed.
  - What are you doing?
  - This is...
  - ...to the left of the bed.
  - Its actually 2.27. Do you see how high up there is?
  - So where are they evenly distributed?
  - Does it move when its full of bites?
  - ...should I take a little weight off that cat?
  - So what happens to the skater?
  - Well, then, if it stays there, is there any more energy?
  - No, but wait till it stops.
  - No, but did the roof drop and bring in all the energy from that little one?
  - Hows that cat getting that heat?
  - The question of why...
  - Dont be scared!
  - You son of a bitch.
  - So the total energy...
  - What were we trying to figure out?
  - Do we have to write...
  - Is that shit?
  - That didnt help at all.
  - What did he say?
  - Is that a sit...
  - ...that the cats been like a real scar for a long time, so its like...
  - Look, I dont know.
  - Thats it.
  - A cat that hot?
  - But why is that skater...
  - Im not making any sense.
  - No, Im not.
  - Is that the track thats on it or is that the...
  - What else is there?
  - What do you say to the total energy?
  - Did you think we should look at the wire first?
  - I know.
  - Well, what about the gravity, right?
  - Im sure it wont change.
  - What was that cover for?
  - Yes, I did.
  - That motion energy and heat energy is really small now because, would that, would
    that matter affect it?
  - ...so its kind of like that video thing.
  - The law of conservation of energy.
  - Yeah, at the same time.
  - How do I put the kinetic and potential energies...
  - ...or what...
  - Does the speed increase with the mass increasing?
  - Im not going to.
  - Now its not, thats the prick I think.
  - Arent we thinking about the same thing?
  - I mean, I...
  - ...thats how we thought out loud.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Im not doing my job right now.
  - But was it the first time they didnt put it in?
  - ...not when...
  - ...not when it seems, theres a little weight...
  - But why is this, how does the speed of the skater change, and why?
  - Its not gonna change.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Im sure hell come up with a comment that were on the wrong topic, considering
    security.
  - The first thing Id say is this is a tommys measurement.
  - But we were able to get through the tonic...
  - ...and its going to be gone.
  - You know, were just gonna go to the wire or...
  - ...is it easier to get out of here?
  - Well, weve been dealing with it.
  - Well, yeah, we are.
  - Were kind of told from here that it is.
  - Do we have to define what ramp were using here?
  - No, its the same in all of these.
  - Yes, I did.
  - I guess it doesnt matter.
  - It says the same thing to everyone.
  - Yeah, and what happens to that heat energy?
  - Im sure it will be soon, if not soon.
  - But what if it stops, then it shrinks?
  - How can you get it there if the speed stays the same?
  - No, its not. Is it going to be ten?
  - If you put a lot of it in.
  - Lets go wherever you turn.
  - And now, does that not include business, potential, and...
  - I know.
  - ...that it doesnt count them all.
  - So, do we have a...
  - That was the job.
  - What are you doing? What are you doing?
  - Should I go where...
  - What?
  - ...there is a measure...
  - ...that you can really do it.
  - Thats the skaters weight.
  - ...not to get it.
  - Gradually, it gets bigger.
  - Well, I guess you can just jump to conclusions.
  - ...we may not be so stupid right now.
  - So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
    wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
    wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
    wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
  - Whats the matter with you?
  - ...that heat energy?
  - But how do I put it?
  - Im not going to.
  - You are a genius.
  - I didnt understand what it said.
  - You were too loud...
  - Or something.
  - Oh, we didnt... we talked too much.
  - Im not going to.
  - But that.
  - Yeah, we dont think thats what it is?
  - Were on the move.
  - No, Im not.
  - But...
  - ...that Im gonna keep the maximum speed the same?
  - But why?
  - I guess...
  - I dont know.
  - But why?
  - Its not gonna change because, I dont know.
  - Why?
  - Because, I cant tell.
  - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
  - What did you write in there?
  - Thats good.
  - I dont understand what youre saying.
  - Yeah, can we go to the next one?
  - Can I just put that upstairs?
  - I know.
  - If you dont understand, then you can.
  - Well, I dont know.
  - But if we understand that middle, do they really understand that it is the middle?
  - So, it says here that in the lower half of the upper half...
  - Im not going to.
  - ...thats what Im assuming, but then down here means really down there.
  - Im reading from the bottom through the bottom.
  - What can we say?
  - I wonder what I said to those preliminary questions.
  - Im not drinking tea. Im probably just going to be drinking a lot of wood grass.
  - This is annoying because its just a chatter going on over there, were talking.
  - I guess speed was the right term, when speed means that acceleration.
  - Thats an interesting question.
  - Shouldnt this be so neutral?
  - I dont know. I dont know.
  - Well, thats all it is.
  - Yes, you are.
  - So whats in the introduction?
  - So, whats the conclusion?
  - I dont know, I dont know.
  - Its a bit greedy.
  - No, Im just thinking, why do you want to know when it was explained in the actual
    video?
  - Is it going faster?
  - So its slower now, isnt it?
  - I mean, what?
  - But its... dont you think its faster when its smaller?
  - No, Im not.
  - When I think it is.
  - Heat energy...
  - And what brought the other?
  - Well, here we go.
  - What do you see now?
  - So Im writing down that the greater the mass, the greater the energy?
  - What?
  - Shouldnt we just put this in here that this is what affects the energies, so
    that the energy of motion...
  - And whats the other one?
  - The second one is the motion energy.
  - It starts with a "P".
  - Im not going to...
  - Its the potential energy.
  - No, but... you need to write about it?
  - Its not gonna stay the same.
  - Not when Im...
  - I mean, I...
  - Were gonna put it in... I dont know what this is about.
  - Or will it change?
  - But lets think about this, that this is the size of the thing.
  - Yeah, so its not because of the size?
  - So Im sure it makes it clear that theyre the same...
  - They just can t get it to live up to their hype.
  - Well, dont we get along really well?
  - We get it, and then it is.
  - I dont know if its on top.
  - I dont know when Im gonna be the last one to write.
  - Do you need to write at that speed?
  - Can you do that?
  - Okay, was that the second point in there?
  - You should mention that the heat energy...
  - No, you dont have to.
  - Heat energy in alternation.
  - Its business energy.
  - So business energy?
  - Its business.
  - So, youre not?
  - Heat energy.
  - Its a little small.
  - Thats what I had to put down.
  - I didnt think about it.
  - Im not going to.
  - Im not a sword.
  - But what is it?
  - Ive been thinking the wrong way.
  - ...do I write this down to conclude that the more mass, the more energy?
  - Wait, where, where, if you make it big?
  - Yeah, what was that potential energy thing?
  - So it was true what the video explained that it contained, say.
  - Oh, all of them.
  - Why doesnt it move at all now? Thats the common thread.
  - Well, I dont know.
  - But here, no one asks, how does the speed of the skater change and why?
  - Should we put it on?
  - Well, put that on.
  - Should I ask?
  - Its not exactly the same as the first one.
  - The principle of conservation of total energy is central to physics.
  - Its just asking us questions.
  - Yeah, well, isnt that what the video explained, that energy doesnt seem to go
    away?
  - You can illustrate.
  - It didnt tell us directly that the energy wasnt going to go away.
  - But he probably thinks were smart enough to be understood.
  - What was the question we were going to answer?
  - Why is the business changing?
  - Yeah, could you give me some physical explanation, and not just because its up
    there?
  - Well, thats not enough.
  - Yeah, whats your physical explanation?
  - I dont have any, but Im thinking
  - But the question is, how does the speed of the skater change and why...
  - ...or fuck, I should have written that speed would accelerate down and slow down
    up.
  - It doesnt matter what word you use.
  - Now what?
  - Oh, why does it do that?
  - Oh, why is it shrinking and accelerating?
  - But why is it at its lowest point?
  - I mean, I dont really know these things because Im sick of physics.
  - But then...
  - Its the same, but its okay.
  - Do we think were such a...
  - ...better than AI?
  - I know.
  - We are.
  - Are we all right?
  - I bet you did.
  - Because its trying to be human and were not...
  - ...so we are.
  - I know.
  - Hey, youre answering the next one.
  - Was this 10 minutes, or was this 20 minutes?
  - Yes, sir, I know.
  - I got it.
  - So whats the question?
  - Does that heat at any point decrease?
  - Its counting, but its not.
  - After youve been at the stop for long enough, is that still the case?
  - Yeah, it counts, but it just...
  - ...now show me how it changes in that.
  - But where does it go?
  - It hasnt been there long enough.
  - Well, what if you put less of that bitterness and shit on it when...
  - Thats it?
  - Are those what we were supposed to do here?
  - Put it on, is there any more?
  - So what was the first one?
  - So what am I gonna write?
  - What does it say about total energy?
  - Is that the whole...
  - The whole thing.
  - Why? - I dont know.
  - Its not that.
  - What was that?
  - Who is...
  - Im not.
  - No, would it be kinetic?
  - Wait, what was that other one?
  - The potential was
  - Thats how it was.
  - Were gonna check it out and see what it looks like.
  - The whole energy.
  - Im not...
  - Im not going to.
  - Do we have to ask that country?
  - I dont remember exactly what youre thinking.
  - Why do you read it moving?
  - But what is it?
  - Or is it changing fast?
  - Kinesthetic or kinesthetic?
  - Is it Finnish? Is it business energy?
  - The kinetic one.
  - Because thats where the potential and the energy of the business is.
  - I dont understand what youre saying.
  - Im not.
  - Is that the kinetic energy thats moving?
  - The potential energy wasn t there up there.
  - But is that kinetic energy?
  - Because thats where we talk about business energy and potential.
  - I dont understand why thats so understandable.
  - Thats it.
  - Yes, you are.
  - I mean, what?
  - The Good Whole Task
  - This black guy doesn t bring physics to a chemistry teacher.
  - No, its not black.
  - Well, I don t know.
  - I dont know what stage it might be.
  - Well, I don t know.
  - Do we have any more?
  - I know.
  - Im not going to.
  - I dont understand the basic concepts.
  - What can we ask?
  - Were so confused.
  - Well, what was that last one about?
  - It had the heat in that video.
  - What do you want me to put on?
  - Hey, do we have a whole lot of beers on by accident?
  - No, its not.
  - Its been nothing.
  - So what do I put on?
  - Funny thing is, I noticed something out there.
  - So is the potential energy such that it doesnt actually move?
  - The potential is moving.
  - Yeah, its got something like that.
  - Its a little like me, and I have the potential to stay put, but Im not doing
    anything.
  - How about that top?
  - Im not.
  - Im not sure.
  - Have you read them?
  - Well, I dont need to know.
  - Yes, I did.
  - It wasnt...
  - Its not fair.
  - Should we be that kind of energy?
  - I kind of think logically that I thought it would go faster.
  - Well, do I write here that...
  - So what are we gonna put in here?
  - Not here when you have to.
  - Maybe I should have something.
  - Maybe something should...
  - I know.
  - Im not seeing the right way.
  - Yeah, its kind of like this.
  - What am I...
  - This is one of those...
  - So, is that what its all about, you dont grow it?
  - The overall energy is increasing.
  - I know.
  - I wouldnt have known otherwise without this board.
  - Neither do I.
  - But then I realized that that reward is the only one that doesnt move like that.
  - It doesnt matter if anything like that...
  - I remember from physics class that the total energy is always the same.
  - What about it?
  - All right, thats it, isnt it?
  - Now we have the first part.
  - Did you?
  - Didnt you...
  - Is that real?
  - Yeah, I know.
  - I dont even know what were talking about. I just fell out of the carriage.
  - How do you say that?
  - We didn t think of that.
  - Im not sure what to do.
  - Im not.
  - The total energy is asked separately.
  - Will we rewrite it?
  - Well, what was that instruction?
  - How much?
  - Did it take something to write?
  - Whats the matter?
  - Can we just make a few observations?
  - I wonder if I can see it.
  - I think they gave it to me.
  - I dont know. Im not sure.
  - Oh, Im not sure.
  - But, you know,
  - So, thats not the speed thats going up there.
  - And then we have to try to be quick, so we can get together for dinner before
    that workout...
  - ...so it cant be too late.
  - Yeah, no, no, but I dont think this is gonna last that long.
  - An hour of this was reserved for this mission...
  - ...we started with 20 tops, so yeah.
  - Hell understand.
  - Well, you know the answers.
  - ...you dont need anything here.
  - Thats it.
  - I think that the previous sentence should be that the energy of motion and the
    energy of potential is converted into heat energy.
  - I wrote that youre energetic.
  - The energy.
  - Yeah, but that...
  - ...yes, they will, yes, they will understand.
  - Well, the question is, what happens to the energies, so...
  - I mean, thats just...
  - All right, but the move...
  - ...well, the right answer would still be that energy of movement.
  - Its good.
  - Well, its in there.
  - I dont know. We dont need this assurance yet.
  - No, Im not.
  - No, not at all.
  - Is that the beginning?
  - No, I guess theres a premise to that.
  - ♪ A bunch of little ones ♪
  - How small it gets
  - Same... but this wasnt a bit of a fight, so maybe it had something to do with
    the fact that...
  - I guess you wouldn t care.
  - Uh, no. Lets try it on the bitterness so we can figure out whats going on.
  - Look, its probably coming next time.
  - The Jeep
  - I dont think we should put it on yet. Lets just stay here.
  - I dont know, but should it be at the same time?
  - What Im asking is, does it affect...
  - That, uh, mass.
  - What, the whole energy thing?
  - What is it that it asks?
  - Yes, I did.
  - Its all over the place.
  - Are there any laws of nature or connections?
  - And how do you think the mass would affect it?
  - That sounds a little like no, because its like, well, how do you think that could
    be?
  - Or maybe I was just...
  - Were trying to understand what total energy means.
  - It doesnt want to help us.
  - No, Im not.
  - Is that where it writes the answer?
  - Okay, what are we gonna put in here?
  - Isnt that the video that says that the potential energy is in place, and then
    the kinetic energy is released?
  - We were supposed to look for...
  - We were supposed to look for a place where the potential...
  - Its number two.
  - What?
  - Im sorry about that.
  - I know.
  - Lets go to the second floor.
  - Hey, what was that question?
  - I dont know. Im not sure.
  - I dont know. Im not sure.
  - Do you think I should talk to us like this?
  - Im sure hes happy with the way were working.
  - I see.
  - Yes, I did.
  - If it wasn t, you can t help it.
  - Good, next one.
  - This is a tough one.
  - However, we know that its in the middle of it, so it doesnt have to be in the
    middle.
  - I just want to...
  - Well, we can get it.
  - But that between that and the top of the stairs is like...
  - Which should be explained.
  - I mean, everybody knows the page.
  - Lets do it.
  - Lets put it that way.
  - Then we must start changing
  - Do we have to be in this whole introduction?
  - When I realized there were three more pictures in there.
  - As I said, the second question is a little bit about what happens to energy and
    why.
  - Thats what we really have to say in the first round.
  - No, Im not.
  - I think it stays the same all the time.
  - Looks like a permanent one.
  - Thats the monster pressure now came from a five-minute announcement.
  - But no, Im not.
  - But it wasnt just about this point.
  - And yet, we have a new era here.
  - Well, we could have done this.
  - So, was it with the fact that the business energy...
  - Heat energy face yeah put it
  - Okay, so its the same thing.
  - ...when its on this paper.
  - Ive been cheated on.
  - What?
  - This is a trick.
  - What was that about?
  - Whats the small one?
  - Is there a 20?
  - So we read the instructions wrong.
  - Oh, my God.
  - I know.
  - I dont understand this.
  - But it was gradual.
  - It wouldnt have been like that.
  - ...that would have been the right answer.
  - And then I realized that it was probably that speed...
  - I dont know the curve where A, B, C...
  - ...and you score, and thats fine.
  - Yeah, were going to disappear.
  - What was it supposed to say?
  - We dont need a pen.
  - Is that the total energy thats growing, or is it?
  - Is that what it says?
  - Yeah, its that mechanical energy.
  - No, I mean, dont you have to answer all these questions?
  - But when it wasnt always composed of total energy, it avoided...
  - Well, its made up of...
  - Or, well, I dont know.
  - I thought there was supposed to be a ramp like this here.
  - Couldnt you have changed that, too?
  - All right, now we can cover that last question.
  - Okay, now lets move on to the next one.
  - And the video said that when it doesnt move, it gets bigger.
  - Yeah, well, I guess it doesnt need to be that fast, but at the bottom of the
    ramp, its the biggest.
  - But here, too, they seemed to be talking about the lower half of the upper half.
  - But it doesnt matter that its there alone.
  - Was there any other question?
  - Ive been able to get some benefit from my physics studies.
  - I got it.
  - Or if it stops, wait.
  - Good work, Elli.
  - Yeah, thats really good.
  - Can you see it in here?
  - Yeah, get them out of here.
  - I was like, whats this like anyway, even though theres no potential energy,
    but its there now.
  - Hey, we did this.
  - We did this.
  - Im not going to.
  - Oh, there was nothing else?
  - The same thing as the real thing in the book.
  - Do we have to do this?
  - And what we had to talk about is the cover-up.
  - How to put it on the skateboard
  - Okay, what else?
  - ... and the
  - ♪ Yes, at night ♪
  - Whats going on?
  - I dont know if Im seeing anything.
  - I dont see any difference.
  - Is it slowing down a little?
  - Isnt that the same speed?
  - Its probably just showing.
  - Its a different size.
  - And just because its not that biting, doesnt it stay the same?
  - Should we?
  - Shall we go up?
  - How does the mass of the seater affect the energies?
  - But is it really just a fantasy?
  - Yes, I did.
  - Well, should we write something about that?
  - Well, not thought about.
  - Thats it.
  - You need answers.
  - Isnt that the same total energy?
  - If the speed is accelerating, is the energy going to increase?
  - Why? - I dont know.
  - But thats a little bit like why the speed changes?
  - I mean, it happens like that, but why does that speed change?
  - So whats our answer to why its slow?
  - It cant take that long if you put that because
  - I dont know. I dont know.
  - Well, yeah, but I mean...
  - Why is it growing?
  - Why does it really grow?
  - So I understand whats going on, but why is it happening?
  - Its actually quite interesting.
  - Well, we can basically ask that from the world, but...
  - But... yeah.
  - This is probably...
  - Its not the same as our...
  - Its not direct, but if you could just figure it out...
  - What do you want me to put on?
  - What are you...
  - Did it seem like...
  - Its gonna be a long time, or what did you design it for?
  - Do they understand that? Maybe I dont know.
  - At least its the gravity of the earth.
  - But do you have to put this on when youre going down, or...
  - Im sure they wont find out my handwriting.
  - Yeah, but I dont know if theyll figure out what were talking about.
  - Well, get them.
  - If not, then...
  - But is it true that the potential energy stays the same?
  - We figured it out that second time, but not that first.
  - Or maybe he was thinking something completely wrong.
  - We were using the wrong concept at first.
  - But it is.
  - But should we ask ourselves, by any means, that energy, that is, we must also
    respond to that movement energy and then
  - And thats not going to affect the heat energy because thats all it has.
  - Like the wind doesnt blow, thats what its all about.
  - How are we gonna start messing around?
  - I was wondering how our thoughts got crossed.
  - We were, and now theyre just crossed.
  - You dont have to think about potential energy. It doesnt need that.
  - So the energy doesnt, or it stays the same.
  - But so is how its written.
  - Well, it doesnt matter that weve done a lot of points at the same time.
  - Thats it.
  - I guess they realize theyre like...
  - The Tajou
  - Were not confused.
  - Its not clear.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Im going after you.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Good afternoon.
  - Don t slow down.
  - Isnt that what it was like?
  - I know.
  - Yeah, theyd be in there about halfway.
  - I dont know what that means, talking all the time.
  - You know what I just noticed?
  - Im not.
  - Maybe... Ill talk to you from your own perspective.
  - So what?
  - Good attention.
  - Thats the total energy.
  - We have plenty of time.
  - But then...
  - Eiku, yeah, nothing.
  - Not when it was next.
  - But...
  - Well, I guess its okay.
  - So you say what Im writing now.
  - Theres no problem.
  - Hey, what are we supposed to do?
  - But what were we supposed to do?
  - Ive done a lot of stuff in physics with this.
  - Its a deadly thing.
  - No, no, no, no, Im not going to.
  - This way.
  - So less than five?
  - Can you see anywhere here where it says here how the mass of a skater affects
    energy?
  - We need to know.
  - Im not going to.
  - Well, thats not gonna help much, Im going to the roof, so Im gonna have to
    go to the roof.
  - I wonder what happened when I left this camera.
  - Im sure we ll be left out of this.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Its too vague.
  - Yeah, so what do we do?
  - What was the question?
  - Is that it?
  - So why is this guy asking us questions back?
  - Help me, please!
  - Youre not?
  - Some famous equation.
  - Chat GPT is for me like...
  - Its a direct answer.
  - What did you say?
  - Im gonna speed it up, break it when I put it on...
  - Yeah, heres the thing about how the speed of the guitar changes.
  - Does this make any sense to you, the damage that it did when it was untied?
  - Yeah, I guess.
  - Not a bit.
  - Yeah, I mean, because, of course, its the bites that slow it down, and Im just
    wondering how it keeps spinning like that all the time, but...
  - What?
  - Mass. What?
  - Look at the potential energy and the movement... its probably the potential energy.
  - It got this much bigger, this much bigger, when the tonne came close to the letter
    that separated it.
  - I know.
  - What was that potential energy anyway?
  - Do you think we should use more AI or not?
  - Im sure you do.
  - Yeah, I dont know. Im not sure.
  - Im sure you do.
  - Were so good at making judgments.
  - Annies a physics major.
  - Isnt that the power source?
  - Is that it?
  - I know.
  - But when it came up, it was...
  - So, how do I write, just put the bars in the middle of the ramp...
  - Should we ask that guy why the power of the skater is the greatest at the bottom
    of the ramp?
  - It looks good.
  - It asks why it might be.
  - Thats it.
  - Have you thought about it?
  - Youre not being terribly helpful to me right now.
  - Im sorry, but youre playing...
  - No, Im not.
  - Would you like to think about how?
  - I dont want to.
  - I dont want to.
  - No, Im not.
  - It wasnt helping again.
  - Do you want me to put it on?
  - Is he on the way up, too?
  - And is it?
  - Yes, I did.
  - How do we know the time travel?
  - Yeah, even to the point where you cant smell how long weve been made.
  - Well, can you think of any reason for that?
  - I dont think you need to.
  - What, its going all the way up now?
  - Well, Kepa didnt put it up there to go.
  - Oh, yeah, I did.
  - What is this place?
  - Just, thats what it said on the video.
  - Well, were not confused.
  - Okay, all right.
  - So Im not going to pick it or what?
  - But this is the energy... this is the uh?
  - I dont remember these.
  - Shall we put it back?
  - So now the question is, what energy is happening now?
  - Bring the same thing.
  - Weve been spotting it.
  - Or, well, its the next thing you can call total energy.
  - So, can you move on?
  - Or, was it not all the time?

  examples:
  - Im a skateboarder on the ramp.
  - A small value includes...
  - So, what?
  - Put that gravity on.
  - Gravity is in the center.
  - In the middle, like that.
  - Then maybe youll pick it up,

  - Can I get this up from the east?
  - Yeah, thats right.
  - Now it weighs 25 kilos.
  - Now, do you want to add more?
  - Good luck. The roof over there is clear.
  - The business and...
  - The potential energy is going that way.
  - I know.
  - The potential energy goes up when it goes up there.
  - Then well add the weight to five.
  - Now thats what Im saying...
  - Lets see.
  - This would be 25.
  - Here, were going to take 100 pounds.
  - Its the same thing.
  - Yeah, well, the energy levels are just going up.
  - Yeah, thats true.
  - Grows it.
  - Yeah, more mass.
  - Yes, yes.
  - A larger mass adds energy levels.
  - Or energy.
  - Amount.
  - Or the amount of energy.
  - Its summed up over there.
  - Yes.
  - That makes sense.
  - So, its this, right?
  - Yes.
  - Yeah, its growing in proportion to the mass.
  - Its at its peak now.
  - Thats the potential.
  - And then when its released, then...
  - But the heat energy keeps growing.
  - All right, now, try to see what happens now that I start speeding it up.
  - But if the total amount of energy,
  - is kinetic energy plus the potential energy.
  - This was a huge...
  - Thats it.
  - Lets get a ton of it.
  - Thats the speed of a tommon.
  - about 13 meters per second at its maximum.
  - Yes, you are.
  - Then if we add it up to five, maybe.
  - Its not always the same.
  - Not if we put more.
  - Im going to eat.
  - The speed will remain the same.
  - Yeah, the speed stays the same.
  - Usually, the maximum speed stays the same.
  - Yes, I did.
  - No matter what the mass.
  - I dont think I got it up there.
  - You can lift that skater up.
  - Thats like, potential energy.
  - Its just theres no business at all.
  - Then put that skater down a ton.
  - Or you can just take it off like that.
  - It used to be this sweet, when its a roof...
  - If I pull it, I can pull it.
  - Youre pulling it all the time.
  - It sees how much potential energy it has, the higher it is.
  - Look, there, I got it.
  - Its up there.
  - Yeah, up the ramp.
  - Here and then...
  - Its zero down there.
  - Yeah, that potential energy.
  - Because were...
  - ...its not really that kind of traffic, when its kind of out of motion.
  - Itll keep it on hold.
  - But youre gone, you can put on that slow case.
  - Thats probably even easier to get out of the way.
  - Just like when were halfway through this business.
  - ...about as big as you.
  - Then at the bottom of this, the kinetic energy is at its maximum and the potential
    energy is at zero.
  - Its right here.
  - I know.
  - Halfway between.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Lets try this.
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - Its halfway between the two.
  - Halfway through...
  - By the time we get down.
  - So its up by the time I get up.
  - Yeah, just the way we go up or down, halfway.
  - Halfway up the ramp.
  - By the time we get down...
  - Its like the energy of movement and potential...
  - Thats the sum of them.
  - The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy.
  - Its going to be that heat energy.
  - Then jump when the skaters down.
  - What happens to the first skater...
  - ...thats why its slowing down.
  - Im not.
  - The skater is slowing down.
  - And then the energy changes shape.
  - Its slowing down.
  - Yeah, its slowing down.
  - The kinetic and potential energy is converted into thermal energy.
  - Its just heat energy.
  - For thermal energy
  - Then the total energy stays the same.
  - Thats where we put five.
  - Hes a five-pound skater.
  - Im going to do 10.
  - Isnt that 15 now?
  - Yeah, well, then.
  - You could raise it up a step.
  - Its bigger than that.
  - I know.
  - That speed stays the same all the time.
  - Yeah, and the journey its on.
  - I know.
  - At least when the power of the machine comes in.
  - Isnt it just that
  - For the transport of larger masses
  - We need more energy.
  - Put it on Skinny Legend.
  - Its energy, because it takes less energy then it does.
  - Because it requires...
  - Its got the same business.
  - Its not going away with anything unreserved.
  - So, what does the mass of the skater do to the energy?
  - A larger mass needs more energy to move.
  - But on a rough track...
  - One step at a time
  - Wait a minute.
  - The larger mass needs...
  - More energy to move.
  - Ill give you the number...
  - The energy...
  - For movement
  - Move it up.
  - Anyway, or a joke.
  - On a rough road
  - The energy wont go away.
  - Put it in a way that the energy doesnt move or change form.
  - I know.
  - No movement, no other way.
  - I know.
  - Its a different way.
  - Put a lot of that mass on.
  - Oh, yeah, yeah.
  - It was like the mass is something small.
  - So, youre gonna raise it gradually?
  - The total energy.
  - The greater the mass, the greater the total energy.
  - Oh, yeah, I did.
  - The more mass, the more total energy.
  - Yes, I did.
  - No, not at all.
  - And the speed of the track is...
  - The unknown.
  - The speed is unchanged.
  - On a straight line, the speed will not change.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Because its not sharp.
  - Because theres no counter force to that movement.
  - Then if it stops, theres no other force.
  - The speed will not change because
  - Because theres no resisting force.
  - Because theres no resistance.
  - Good afternoon, stunt dog.
  - Its upstairs.
  - Put someone on the stand.
  - A 50 pound dog.
  - How many
  - And then the area is uncluttered.
  - And then its up there.
  - Let it go once, and well see how it changes.
  - Im not going to.
  - Im not going to.
  - Yes, that means the traffic flow is the highest of all.
  - Well, this is how it turns into a cat.
  - I mean, good luck.
  - Put it up there.
  - So its right up there on the ramp?
  - This is just...
  - Im under the ramp.
  - At the low point
  - The potential energy is at the highest point of the ramp and the traffic flow
    is at the lowest point of the ramp.
  - Halfway through the ramp.
  - Or Id rather write that Im in the middle of the road.
  - Im just writing in the middle.
  - Put it in motion.
  - You mean there?
  - ♪ As high as the sky ♪
  - So, the whole energy is just poetry?
  - The overall energy is unchanged.
  - Or it stays the same.
  - Theres two different ones.
  - Its the traffic.
  - Two FPS.
  - Put it there.
  - Energy
  - Power it.
  - Oh, are you really a lot?
  - Well, put a lot on.
  - No, Im not.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Put it on.
  - Oh, my God, the ceiling.
  - Fung, you know what?
  - What happens to the skater?
  - Heat energy.
  - Its a hot spring thats gonna generate heat energy from the ground.
  - It slows down, then it stops.
  - Its slowing down.
  - And then...
  - Finally stops...
  - And the energy of the skater is converted into thermal energy, into biting.
  - Theyre really pumping.
  - Its getting smaller.
  - The potential of the moving energy is converted into thermal energy.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Dont start putting pressure on me right now.
  - This is the one thats gonna take it up.
  - Its the same thing all the time.
  - The total energy stays the same all the time.
  - The bitch can make it from there.
  - Not at all, very much.
  - ...theres nothing in there right now.
  - Its right over there.
  - I had to put it on...
  - The skateboard ramp.
  - Lets just put five.
  - Now its ten.
  - Ill see you on that side.
  - Do I have to put this on that skateboard or...
  - Youre a fool!
  - Lets get this thing on the table.
  - Put it on your head.
  - Not when... okay, this way.
  - Not when I hit that skateboard.
  - That skateboard isnt gonna stay in place enough to be...
  - I wish.
  - Lets change the wire.
  - No, now that disappearance is just a moment.
  - It looks like its off the track somehow.
  - Height, speed...
  - Can we get another skateboard from that?
  - Then well change the mass.
  - Now, just leave it in the same place and edit the mass...
  - ...and well see how it changes.
  - Now its 35.
  - Its not going that far.
  - No, not like that.
  - Im not.
  - Right there.
  - Theres these white dots...
  - Thats how you put it with that one.
  - You can put it down here.
  - Yes, right here.
  - It changes the place, leaves it to someone else, and it always shows up.
  - But there it is, like, there.
  - Yeah, but then if we turn the mass up, then the energy goes up.
  - At least the business is growing.
  - So when the mass increases, the energy increases.
  - Im not going to.
  - I know.
  - Not yet, not yet.
  - If thats what you put a ton of it in, then...
  - But here its really small.
  - Its right there, like down there.
  - I mean, its just growing.
  - That potential...
  - The potential energy is as big as it is, but the movement energy is as small as
    it is.
  - Well, I guess just because the kinetic energy is lower up there, I guess it stops
    basically there, but then all the heat... well, the heat isnt in the visor, but...
  - Well, the whole...
  - The potential energy...
  - ...Yes, but its brought together as full energy as it grows.
  - Not exactly the mass...
  - Yeah, if you can just wrap this thing up like that.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Thats a lot of mass right now, so its like 4,000 little over.
  - And if I put it like a little...
  - Its really small.
  - Yeah, those numbers are the same.
  - So if the mass increases, then the amount of energy increases.
  - The overall energy is growing.
  - The total energy increases with mass.
  - ...and a helmet on the head.
  - Its safe.
  - A cat weighing 70 pounds.
  - Yes, you are.
  - What?
  - Yes, I did.
  - Its 10.54 on the clock.
  - Not that way.
  - Its always there when its gone.
  - Its 10.54
  - Its 10.54
  - No, its the same, it stays the same.
  - Its the same.
  - If we put the tie somewhere here.
  - Yeah, so the speed stays the same, or the speed.
  - If you put it in, I would.
  - But its not...
  - Theres 5.4.
  - What?
  - Im not going to lie.
  - Its a little different up and down.
  - But...
  - But theyre the same in small amounts.
  - The mass change...
  - We cant move fast.
  - It doesnt seem to be the speed.
  - The speed of the skater doesnt change with mass.
  - I know.
  - Or change with the change in mass.
  - Oh, my God.
  - So, are we gonna take that one for you or are we gonna take 100?
  - We have a 100-pound cat.
  - It seems reasonable.
  - Is it here?
  - You wouldnt think the potential energy was higher up?
  - There it is, 553. Its not going any further.
  - Lets put it down, put it there, put it in the box when the cat goes in there...
  - ...that we can look at the numbers.
  - I know.
  - Then it had to look down and down.
  - Theres one here.
  - Well, there it is, its a little...
  - ...and then the center is about.
  - I mean, Im sure.
  - Yeah, the higher the potential energy.
  - So, I guess theres a little business power down here?
  - Yeah, its actually like 5,500 and...
  - It keeps getting smaller.
  - Like, every time it goes this way, it stays there for a while and lasts.
  - And then this is it.
  - Thats interesting, so is it in the middle of the process?
  - Its probably somewhere in the middle.
  - Its pretty close.
  - If it goes one higher, what happens to it?
  - Lets check it out.
  - Wheres the next one?
  - Thats it, man.
  - So its right there.
  - Its right there.
  - Well, its not halfway between when its like...
  - Its a little below halfway.
  - Well, thats not the highest point, is it?
  - But it was the highest point this cat was going to.
  - Now that cats not going all the way over there.
  - Its not fast enough.
  - Thats a joke about a 200-pound cat.
  - Theres not enough power to move it.
  - Just a little below halfway.
  - Not in the middle.
  - Halfway through, yeah.
  - Halfway through the ramp...
  - Its back there.
  - Yeah, well, thats it.
  - The total energy stays the same...
  - ...that is, the energy of motion becomes the energy of potential...
  - ...but the total energy is unchanged.
  - I know.
  - Lets put a lot of cork on it.
  - Because bigger than none, do we fill it up?
  - Lets test it.
  - The cat stays put.
  - Its not moving.
  - The cats gonna be down there now.
  - All right, the cats coming back.
  - Im a skater.
  - Because now that energy is just turning into thermal energy in that country and
    then it stops moving at that rate.
  - Its not going to happen.
  - Its a hundred pounds.
  - No, Im not.
  - Well, that velocity stops, and the energy happens to be moving energy to heat
    energy, and then it stops.
  - But the total energy stays the same.
  - No, Im not.
  - Isnt it like if its...
  - Yeah, well, I mean, when its like that...
  - Its so warm after the ton after its been steamed.
  - Look at that little silence, not when you dont.
  - The whole thing...
  - Cheating on the season.
  - What the hell?
  - The total energy...
  - No, Im not.
  - Well, thats the whole energy of the rest of us.
  - Should we...
  - ...and it stays the same.
  - ...that why heat energy...?
  - The power is not...
  - Really need to be scared.
  - ...theyre less when the cats...
  - Im about to start eating my loaf of bread.
  - Not just a skateboarder.
  - ...the skitter has stopped.
  - There was no other side of this.
  - Can I draw flowers or a cat?
  - Draw it.
  - When the skater...
  - ...sounds like it.
  - ...from Sweden.
  - The concept of thermal energy is essentially related to the internal movement
    of the substance.
  - When you think about boiling water, why do you think that the behavior of heat
    energy is such that it will not decrease even if boiling stops?
  - The internal movement of the substance.
  - When you think about cooking water...
  - Isnt that boiled water?
  - What the hell...
  - ...boiling water, why do you think the behavior of the heat energy is such that
    it will not decrease even if the boiling stops?
  - Im sure itll be after the waters heated.
  - Do you think that...
  - Its got an internal movement of the substrate.
  - ...is that the skateboarding and cooking?
  - Theres more movement in hot water, and then when its just getting a little quiet,
    its like...
  - I ll put that gun in the same place.
  - The energy of motion is converted into heat energy.
  - You dont need to think about that heat energy any deeper.
  - So, what?
  - ... forward.
  - Now its got the usual moves of a lot of people.
  - Do you see anything from that...
  - Im not.
  - Well, now it seems.
  - Transportation power. - What is it?
  - Potential energy, heat energy.
  - The potential energy increases when it stops.
  - But now theres never heat energy in it.
  - Its not a bit.
  - Now, what?
  - Yeah, I guess the mass...
  - I bet itll rise when the mass...
  - I know.
  - I know.
  - I know.
  - And that collective energy is rising.
  - Yes, I did.
  - But then every time the mass doesnt rise, every time the mass is the same, then
    the total energy stays the same...
  - Should we be concerned about how the mass of the skater affects the energies...
  - ...that as the mass increases, so does the velocity and energy...
  - ...the total energy is increasing.
  - The power of movement and the power of potential is growing.
  - ...the mass is growing.
  - I know.
  - You want to write?
  - Yeah, well, whatever.
  - Its the night.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Stop it. - What?
  - Well, it grows with the mass.
  - The night...
  - ...if we put it in, then this is also the fact that its...
  - Yeah, it stays the same.
  - Yes, I did.
  - If we put that slider in it, it might be easier when theres only one.
  - Yeah, well, Im gonna have to change that weight.
  - Whats the maximum speed of this thing?
  - Yeah, ten of them.
  - Well, here we go.
  - Yeah, lets just put the whole thing on the big screen.
  - If I do, first a little?
  - In the gutter.
  - And youll be fine if you put all that stuff on.
  - If you can, well put that whole energy in here.
  - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Im not going to go.
  - Its not gonna change. Its just gonna change.
  - But this speed stays the same.
  - This doesnt seem to work.
  - Stay here
  - But if you put on a stick.
  - I didnt want to put it on, so... so the speed limit wont change even if...
  - Yeah, the speeds not changing.
  - ...even if the mass changes.
  - Yeah, well, as long as its not gravity at all...
  - So its...
  - ...like in the vacuum.
  - Yeah, yeah, lets put that on.
  - Speeds at its strongest there, like down there, and then...
  - Its down there.
  - The speed is...
  - Im gonna get that hand in the hole over there.
  - ...at the very least.
  - Its when the kinetic energy is kind of at its strongest, so is the speed...
  - ...and then when the potential energy is at its strongest up there, then the
    speed is also as slow as...
  - Theres a lift down there.
  - Hes got a helmet on his head.
  - Of course, safety is first and foremost.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Ill put that move...
  - Yeah, I have to keep it.
  - Im not going to.
  - Yeah, its not that bitchy at all, and someones standing there halfway.
  - Although, some tommy.
  - 40 is easy.
  - 40 pounds. - What?
  - Well, its in the head.
  - Upstairs, please.
  - So the potential energy is at its highest, like at the top of the ramp.
  - What?
  - Ah, it was just going down.
  - ...it was down there.
  - Have a drink downstairs.
  - Theyre probably about half as big as you.
  - Yes, it is.
  - Yeah, halfway down the ramp, so its gonna be...
  - Up or down.
  - Well, it probably would.
  - Yeah, but its in the middle of the process.
  - Now its pretty good at that.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - The same size...
  - How about halfway?
  - Halfway down and up, coming in.
  - Lets put it that way.
  - And the whole thing...
  - ...well, yeah, full energy, so it stays the same.
  - Im still on the wrong question.
  - The whole energy.
  - Yeah, I mean, someone from there.
  - Its random.
  - What happens to the skateboarder?
  - And the same mass and.
  - Now thats where the heat energy came in.
  - Mm, its going down all the time.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Its like its not going to get that high anymore.
  - The energy level will remain the same.
  - Its like the momentum is shrinking all the time.
  - And the potential energy.
  - Yeah, thats right.
  - The power of movement...
  - ...at the same rate theyre shrinking.
  - Its formed and at the same time, its probably disappearing all the time.
  - ...stay on the ramp and a ton of skateboard rolls, but...
  - Thats not gonna stop, man.
  - So theres just a buildup of seismic energy.
  - Its either in the air or on that ramp or somewhere in the energy, but its the
    same.
  - Well, its slowing down.
  - Yeah, or its not gonna get up there like it always does.
  - It just went away.
  - Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
    no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
    no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
  - Its like Im biting, something.
  - Well, you can put that in the next one, what happens to the energies and why...
  - ...can put that, what, that bites that heat energy.
  - And you get the business and the potential energy, theyre going down in the same
    proportion.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Thats the one thats gonna be missed by the party.
  - You have a good handwriting.
  - Youre a really nice back.
  - Yeah, thats right.
  - I dont think I should write about it when its not worth it.
  - The sharks.
  - And the total energy stays the same.
  - A 40-pound cat, thats pretty cool.
  - It doesnt look like it.
  - Yeah, lets put that down, put that mass away.
  - You can cut the mass.
  - Yeah, just cut the mass down.
  - ...its a 60-pound dog now.
  - Thats it.
  - And the gravity is in the middle.
  - The dog and...
  - Well, now its a small mass.
  - Im not going to.
  - So, what?
  - ...its a little bit of energy.
  - ...and then...
  - ...if you raise it like that.
  - Well, you can see it that way.
  - More energy when the mass increases.
  - Ill put it here, so that...
  - ...one of them...
  - ...and then...
  - ...if I could put the energy up...
  - ...somehow, as the mass increases.
  - Mm, that energy increases with mass.
  - And the energy.
  - Oh, these wires are annoying.
  - Whether its a big one or a big one...
  - ...the great...
  - The plant...
  - Id say when I grow up.
  - Yes, I did.
  - What? - What?
  - Im thinking about how to write a tone.
  - Thats it.
  - Im not going to.
  - So, its a total reward, you know?
  - ...where is that...
  - ...a ton down and a half.
  - Well, its pretty small.
  - It is.
  - ...more mass, yeah.
  - When more mass.
  - So the total energy stays the same, but the total...
  - ...just like that energy form changes.
  - Im gonna put that as a whole...
  - ...energy and...
  - ...because hes going to stay...
  - ...the same as...
  - ...but that...
  - ...the total energy stays the same, but its forms change.
  - Yes, or in principle, really...
  - Or when its like that, like, the energy of the potential, its kind of like...
  - Yeah, yeah, just that it...
  - ...the breasts are different.
  - Yeah, but thats just it.
  - Im not going to be a fan.
  - Well, its got to do with the bitterness...
  - Im not going to.
  - But...
  - Yeah, but Im drunk and I dont see what it says.
  - ...but that, yeah.
  - But it changes shape, so just put it back.
  - What was that?
  - Whats up, man?
  - Its a little mass and its really brought in speed so...
  - What?
  - ...until we take...
  - Put some more mass on, like that.
  - ...more of it.
  - Its growing.
  - Look at the size of the dog, the size of the dog, the mass of the dog.
  - Im not going to.
  - Im not going to.
  - Oh, my God.
  - And it stays with it...
  - ...speed of the...
  - ...stays pretty much the same, yeah.
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
    yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
    yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
    yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
  - Maximum speed will remain the same.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Im not going to...
  - I know.
  - ...but at least since the bitches grow up like that...
  - ...or maybe that energy, not when the speed varies more...
  - Im sure you do.
  - ...depending on the mass, but since theres no bitterness...
  - Maximum remains, maximum speed remains the same.
  - Its not changing.
  - Its not gonna change.
  - Im putting that, which means it doesnt change because, EOS.
  - Okay, the speeds not changing.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Thats good.
  - Theres a size that shows how fast the piece moves.
  - What do you think when you think about how you could describe it in mathematical
    terms?
  - Well, here you go, wise guy.
  - I know.
  - Well, at least when its a little bit in place, thats when the potential energy
    is the greatest.
  - ...and youre so stuck here now that its down there, so that energy of movement...
  - Yes, I did.
  - What does it look like the soul on the other side of the ramp, it?
  - I guess its the same story.
  - All right, so, up the ramp.
  - The potential energy is the greatest...
  - ...up the ramp.
  - The energy of movement, it was just...
  - Its at the bottom.
  - The power grid is the biggest ramp...
  - ...on the ground.
  - Well, its probably halfway between those two.
  - Halfway through.
  - Or from the bottom and bottom, sometimes the bottom, the top.
  - Well, somewhere down there.
  - Down in the middle of the upper half...
  - ...so, why dont we just go downstairs?
  - Ill put that in a minute.
  - ... move, line, and...
  - ...the highs, the ramps...
  - ...in the middle.
  - The total energy is the sum of two other forms of energy...
  - Or...
  - Yeah, or the whole energy...
  - ...is this or is it...
  - ...its a little bit like that if its the same...
  - ...this is it.
  - ...that the total energy remains the same, but its shape changes.
  - Or that, just because the momentum energy is at its highest, the potential energy
    is at its lowest, and the second time around, its a little bit like...
  - Im gonna put the whole energy...
  - Its not gonna change.
  - ...the whole energy of...
  - ...the amount.
  - Its not gonna change.
  - Lets just put it on there and...
  - ...the skater...
  - ...its slowing down.
  - Slow down and stay down.
  - Im gonna put the speed of the skater slowing down and eventually getting to the
    bottom.
  - Eventually... or speed wont be enough.
  - Im going to slow down.
  - And the speed stops at the bottom.
  - Well, that also says the same speed, just like that...
  - ...and the speed...
  - ...and it ends...
  - ...at the end.
  - This is political.
  - Finally, to the bottom of the ramp.
  - Well, thermal energy, its converted into thermal energy as part of...
  - Oh, yeah.
  - Oh, now that guys gone over there.
  - Well, the overall energy wont change again, but keep it up.
  - Yeah, well, heat power is coming.
  - Im not going to.
  - ...Im not gonna put heat energy in the bites.
  - ...that the total energy content of the planet will not change.
  - With a wedge, you are born... not born when its formed.
  - Or it changes. Energy is converted to heat energy.
  - The energy is converted into heat energy...
  - ...three total energies...
  - Im sure youve got a really good pen. Im sure I can get this one.
  - How did I put it? The total energy...
  - ...and its not going to change any more.
  - Slay
  - Good luck. We have to put it down.
  - Lets just put it... like this.
  - Im going to make it bitter.
  - Im not gonna do it.
  - .. to the firm
  - No, not at all.
  - I need to get it sharp, not at all.
  - There you go.
  - No, not when... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
    yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
    yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
    yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
  - Now thats 60. Is that good?
  - A 60
  - Put some value on it.
  - Five pounds. - What?
  - Five of them.
  - Well, give me 40.
  - And then well reinforce five when its down there.
  - Isnt that how the mass was supposed to be?
  - Hurry up.
  - And then what?
  - Not when we started out as the norm.
  - A little bit of value in the mass.
  - I know.
  - ♪ Slowly youve got someone ♪
  - I know.
  - Well, you know, just, like, move it, like, 30 times.
  - Okay, its starting, its going faster.
  - No, Im not.
  - Well, black seems to be slowing down.
  - Now, lets put the five on the gate.
  - Well, lets just put 50 of it straight.
  - Somehow its going to happen over there...
  - He weighs 55 pounds.
  - Its just as fast.
  - Its not.
  - It doesnt matter if you dont have a bit of itch.
  - Its going up and its going down the same path.
  - But I didn t.
  - Well, that kinetic energy...
  - Its the same size.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Let go of me.
  - Or not when...
  - Put it in the hundred.
  - Yeah, put it in the hundred and sit down there, you change it to five, and itll
    fly over that ramp.
  - Well, I mean, theres someone whos gonna stay on the track, so its not...
  - Well, what happens if it flies off, it stays on track?
  - Lets just say the kinetic energy stays the same.
  - Now, listen, lets change it to the fast one.
  - Weight.
  - What?
  - Im going to get it.
  - And the energy is less.
  - No, the energy is greater when the mass was here.
  - Yes, yes, it is bigger.
  - The energy is less when the mass is.
  - Not the bigger one.
  - Well, the bigger, the bigger, and the smaller, the smaller.
  - Can we put a ton of dog skates in?
  - Put it in the tray.
  - Lets get it on.
  - Im scared of you.
  - A hundred-pound dog.
  - Im not going to lie.
  - Hey, you.
  - Take it, stay off the track and lose what it is.
  - Okay, thats it.
  - But it doesnt bring any heat.
  - Then weigh a hundred.
  - And now change it to a shit.
  - Help
  - Isnt that... like a counter?
  - No, Im not.
  - But its going to be business.
  - Well, the total energy is greater than...
  - The bigger the mass.
  - No, Im not...
  - Yes, I did.
  - The energy of motion and the energy of potential are not the same.
  - Well, it stays the same all the time, but it grows with the crowd.
  - I know.
  - The total energy stays the same.
  - It stays the same, but it grows with the crowd.
  - How can a dog not fly off the track?
  - Well, the cake.
  - Is that not...
  - Its lower.
  - Speed
  - Its staying on track.
  - Okay, yeah, I got it.
  - Lets see.
  - Where is it always, if the ton of energy is total...
  - So its growing at a fast pace.
  - Yeah, of course it grows when it goes down like that.
  - No, but Im not...
  - Not when its the same, but its moving.
  - Not when it does, it just shows.
  - I mean, I mean...
  - Well, what do you say we put that in
  - Im not changed.
  - Im not.
  - So it hasnt changed.
  - Its a lot like that.
  - This ones moving faster, but its going to be the same read.
  - Lets take 60.
  - A dog weighing 60 kilos.
  - Yeah, yeah.
  - Yes
  - This is the energy of movement and indeed the potential of the world.
  - The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this
    Regulation.
  - The energy of the movement is at the bottom the largest
  - Its right down there.
  - Yeah, and the potential energy above the
  - Its a potential energy.
  - Up there.
  - Thats when that speed is zero,
  - So the potential energy is at its highest.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - And then the other way around, of course.
  - You have a good handwriting.
  - I was just going to stop.
  - Thank you. - Thank you.
  - Why did you say thank you?
  - Well, thats cool.
  - Thank you.
  - Im scared.
  - It was right there at the bottom.
  - Moving energy at the bottom
  - And the speed is...
  - What? - What?
  - Well, its been put down here.
  - Its got to flow from there.
  - Put it up there.
  - Up as you can.
  - I didnt even know this was possible.
  - Its good now.
  - He stared.
  - In the center.
  - Go and hear it.
  - Its going to the beach.
  - No, Im not.
  - 10.8
  - Meters in seconds.
  - How could you call this like that?
  - Yeah, what ever
  - What if it does?
  - Not when youre.
  - Hes a killer.
  - Yeah, well, it stays the same all the time.
  - (name) what are you doing?
  - Let it go.
  - Well, it stays the same all the time.
  - Can I put the total energy as the constant of the whole time?
  - You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
    you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
    you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
    you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
    you know
  - Is it like that?
  - Im thinking, no need to be when it is.
  - Well, Ill put the same size as that...
  - I know.
  - So, what the hell...
  - Well, lets put it in.
  - Even if its halfway between.
  - Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
    hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
    hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
    hey,
  - Look, it started to get faster right away.
  - From where a little more, well see more clearly
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - Put the skater on the ramp.
  - Well, its going down there.
  - The one that came quietly.
  - If we start it from here.
  - And here comes heat energy.
  - So the speed is slowing down.
  - Yes, you are.
  - You can put on a skateboard from the top and then put on a lot.
  - Put the first bit a lot.
  - Im not going to.
  - Okay, so I guess it was just one?
  - So its not even going there.
  - Well, thats where the heat energy comes in.
  - Im not going to.
  - And thats it.
  - Is the tree coming up?
  - I think theyve been the same thing.
  - But theyre also getting smaller all the time.
  - Thats how the heat energy rises.
  - Heat energy rises, but other energies fall
  - Hurry up to the next one.
  - Dont make it hard on me.
  - Its set to zero.
  - You can put on 35, 30 pounds.
  - 25 years.
  - Im going to do 20.
  - Im going to do 20.
  - Then what?
  - Let go of me.
  - ...its not going to move.
  - Did he leave?
  - What the frick?
  - So it always comes back to the same place.
  - Yes, I did.
  - ...because its not bitter.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Yes, you are.
  - Oh, my God.
  - You think theres no gravity to pull it back to the ground?
  - Well, doesnt it get that gravity by making it so much of that current?
  - Thats how its going to go now.
  - Put some more mass on it.
  - Im gonna need someone to put on a real weight.
  - Lets get someone on it.
  - You can set a maximum.
  - Is that okay?
  - It doesnt seem to affect anything.
  - What? - What?
  - Because theres no bitterness.
  - I mean, isnt it just a little bit more fun, but...
  - Is it going slower?
  - No, Im not...
  - ...thats just a bigger guy than that...
  - ...thats what it looks like.
  - ...push that energy out and change that mass.
  - Well, it seems to be the mass.
  - I mean, the business energy and what?
  - Potential energy.
  - Is that the potential?
  - The potential energy is diminishing.
  - The skeletons mass seems to be...
  - I know.
  - Because the movement...
  - Put it on.
  - ...and put it on.
  - ...or as much business and potential energy as possible.
  - Yeah, the more mass.
  - Yeah, the more mass.
  - Because the band.
  - What?
  - Yeah, the band.
  - So Im gonna blow the potential energy up there, like...
  - ...its getting smaller.
  - Do I have to make fun of this...
  - ...the more mass the joke, the more.
  - I know.
  - Yeah, so it always has it up there, so its like the most...
  - ...potentially.
  - Yes, I did.
  - And when it goes down, it goes down at a tremendous rate.
  - And down there, its out of potential energy.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - ...and up there, it has no movement energy when it goes the other way.
  - Its the one.
  - Well, its just how much it has the potential to get you
  - Yeah, the chance to get energy...
  - ...is that all you know is that youre up or down on a hill...
  - ...and then you.
  - Yeah, so if we stop there, then theres more potential in that...
  - ...the energy of movement like were being put there like that...
  - ...because then its gonna go this way.
  - Well, its always the same when its maximum.
  - The energy is the same all the time.
  - The whole energy.
  - The overall energy is always the same.
  - I know.
  - Whats the matter, huh?
  - Were not being used by AI.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Thats the answer. Lets get to work.
  - Yeah, not when it doesnt lose that energy to anything?
  - Its not gonna change.
  - But, you know,
  - Thats it.
  - The momentum is changing.
  - Yeah, but its not going anywhere because its going the same way every time.
  - Its always slowing down up there.
  - Not as fast as youre gonna be.
  - ...and stops, or so it goes.
  - Yeah, it always has to slow down because it stops.
  - Yes, but even if its weight increases, it will go at the same rate at each point.
  - The speed of the skater changes because it brings the energy of movement.
  - The potential energy is...
  - I mean, I...
  - ...potential energy...
  - ...to get maximum power at the bottom of the power ramp.
  - Im not the one whos...
  - ...and at the bottom of the ramp, the movement energy is at its peak.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Its starting to drop.
  - ...it changes in such a way that it is at its fastest down and its slowest up...
  - Because when it comes down, we always go hard.
  - Ill put the speed down to the fastest...
  - Put it like that.
  - Well, I have the fastest down there and...
  - Can you put the cat in the cat?
  - The boat, yes.
  - Its a dog.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Put the cat on.
  - Oh, yeah, yeah.
  - That looks a little rusty.
  - A 100 kg cat
  - Well, because...
  - The power is at its lowest.
  - Well, because when it comes down from above, of course, the momentum is like that...
  - ...and so on and so forth.
  - ...because its been accelerating all this time, so it cant be at this point
    like...
  - ...being at its fastest in half the time, because its still going to accelerate
    two meters, even more, you know.
  - Were gonna listen to this, and then this just sounds like some crazy man-plan.
  - The bottom.
  - All right, put it in 50.
  - I mean, 50 pounds.
  - ...the cats got a lot of stuff.
  - Up there.
  - Here, put that over there.
  - Kick it in there.
  - Its going to be crazy.
  - ...the weight.
  - Im not going to.
  - ...so Ill put that up.
  - Its up there, above all...
  - ...where it starts to come from...
  - ...because, yeah, if we start here, thats the potential energy less...
  - ...but its the greatest of all...
  - ...thats where the movement starts.
  - The potential energy...
  - ...the greatest...
  - ...from there...
  - ...what about...
  - ...the movement...
  - ...and then...
  - Thank you.
  - All right, then.
  - ...as were trying to stop it.
  - Theres even the possibility of slowing down.
  - Thats easier to stop.
  - So, what?
  - ...until... the point where were like...
  - ...somehow down there...
  - ...thats what its about.
  - ...like this one at the bottom of the ramp...
  - The lowest point.
  - ...at the lowest point, before...
  - ...Im going to ramp up the new stuff, get up.
  - Up, new. - What?
  - Im not going to.
  - The energy of movement is the greatest.
  - Its the biggest ramp...
  - ...the field.
  - Theres a little delay, so its really hard to get.
  - Thats what its like when its on a rough level.
  - There it is.
  - Its true.
  - Thats it.
  - In the middle of the bottom, in the middle of the living ramp.
  - So its between the starting point and the bottom.
  - Just the center.
  - I mean, the...
  - But its the same thing on the other side.
  - Yes, but I mean...
  - But theres that new starting point.
  - But if it really starts in the middle, then thats the point and all.
  - Movement is medicine.
  - Do you need a roof? Im stuck in the camera?
  - Wow, what a great idea.
  - Youre just staring at it.
  - That the uniforms...
  - ...and then we leave.
  - The total energy stays the same.
  - I always do.
  - The departure...
  - ...the unit dimensions of the starting point...
  - ...and the middle of the lowest point.
  - Im not going to.
  - Im not going to.
  - Thats good.
  - Because you look at...
  - ...check this out...
  - ...its not moving.
  - Whether I put a stop, a stop, the whole energy is always the same.
  - Good afternoon.
  - I hope it doesnt fall off.
  - I hope it flies.
  - Put a lot of it in.
  - But no, its not going anywhere anyway.
  - Well, here it goes.
  - Of course it will.
  - So, there was this new...
  - Heat energy.
  - So it produces...
  - ...the whole energy of the same thing all the time...
  - ...but then its heat energy.
  - It changes, the momentum goes down...
  - ...and it changes.
  - ...for heat energy.
  - Well, the speed of the skater is slowing.
  - The speed is slowing down, the movement is slowing down.
  - And it stops at the end.
  - The movement is slowing.
  - Totally, well, potential and movement...
  - Theyre getting smaller.
  - ...the energy is going to be reduced and the heat energy is going to be increased.
  - The potential...
  - ...the potential of...
  - ...the line, and...
  - Im not...
  - Im not...
  - Yeah, but it does the same thing.
  - Its gonna go down, though, because its...
  - ...but its much slower.
  - Itll take longer.
  - The power of movement...
  - Every time it goes off the grid, it brings in heat energy...
  - ...like a little bit of a whirlwind.
  - If I make them change because of the bitterness...
  - It stays the same.
  - Its the same all the time.
  - ...because that heat energy, the movement energy...
  - ...and the potential energy...
  - ...and theyre always on the bridge together...
  - ...the same as the others.
  - Stay with me.
  - Good morning, put it there.
  - Its the force of gravity.
  - Did I add that mass?
  - Well, if its not bitter, it doesnt seem to have any effect.
  - Well, lets write something down and put it in.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Lets put some more of them on and put them on.
  - Put it on.
  - Thats all I need.
  - I know.
  - So without the knife...
  - Im going to...
  - If I can number one, two, three, you can put an ad.
  - Or A B C
  - Not at all, if theres no bitterness.
  - The energy, in a way...
  - How is that...
  - So, hey, ask me what total energy means.
  - So, kinetic, or I think its kinetic.
  - Thats it.
  - The potential.
  - Youre gonna write it?
  - So, what?
  - Because it was in English.
  - Is it kinetic?
  - I think it said kinetic.
  - So, what do I put on?
  - Then put that slide on.
  - The total energy is kinetic.
  - But it hasnt changed.
  - Put it where you want it.
  - Is it going faster than whats left?
  - Well, I wont.
  - I dont think it really matters.
  - Its not gonna change.
  - Put it on so it doesnt change at all.
  - Yeah, lets put it in the 60s.
  - I know.
  - It would look like this way.
  - Im not.
  - There you go.
  - At the bottom
  - So what do you want to write?
  - Put it down there.
  - Is that the bottom or is that the name?
  - Yes, you are.
  - So, whats it like? Its gonna come so sharp.
  - Yeah, well, I guess it is.
  - Why is it a potential and a movement?
  - Yeah, the potential, the one where it stops a little bit like before it starts
    again.
  - We have
  - Its not?
  - Or it does, and its not like its gonna stop.
  - I wrote somewhere.
  - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
    wait, wait, wait.
  - Is that a move... wait.
  - Is that the movement energy at the bottom?
  - Yeah, the kinetic energy is at the bottom of the potential up there.
  - Its the kinetic energy.
  - Yeah, all right, yeah.
  - I cant think right now.
  - We have this message.
  - I mean, it was at the same time.
  - Theyre the same size.
  - Well, should we ask the last question, that is, is there any movement energy and
    potential energy...
  - ..when its up there..
  - Now, now, theres a half-way point.
  - Logically, Im not.
  - Thats it.
  - If one is at the bottom and the other is at the top
  - I d like to have a chance.
  - Theyre the same size.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Well, thats what it is.
  - Its kind of a little bit.
  - I know.
  - Put it on.
  - Its okay with the roof.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Not yet.
  - Halfway up.
  - Or the bill.
  - Its just that theres both the movement and the...
  - Potential energy
  - Time is turning around
  - Not really up there anyway.
  - Well, if youll just put it on, write it down.
  - Yeah, well put it in there.
  - The total energy you could not unleash.
  - What (name) says
  - What do you mean,
  - Well, since thats the dress, I dont know your right hand.
  - Lets put yes to D, that it has mechanical energy.
  - So whats in it?
  - Ill write it down if you figure something out.
  - Put it like a hook, the skater has mechanical energy.
  - Eli put it this way "I live by kinetics, and what it was, it was kinetic energy, kinetic energy and potential".
  - Put the edge higher than none.
  - Put the skater on the ramp.
  - ..screwing up.
  - Youre gonna have to throw it in there, I guess.
  - More bitches than none
  - ♪ Cut to zero ♪
  - Its slowing down.
  - Its slowing down and...
  - And finally, it stops.
  - It slows down and eventually stops.
  - Lets go down there with zero.
  - Its no longer a source of its own.
  - Theres no potential.
  - Its probably gonna slow down the same way it does when that speed slows down.
  - Thats not gonna work anymore.
  - Im sure youve heard that energy doesnt go away in any form of change.
  - So Im actually getting a voice, so should I put the power of movement in?
  - I know.
  - Im not.
  - Well, here we have that energy tree.
  - The guy whos skating.
  - Well, its gonna change shape, I guess, but its not gonna go away.
  - Slow down.
  - Can you think of anything else?
  - No more.
  - Well, if it goes, its going down.
  - Well, then thats the potential.
  - Or is it a little bit like potential energy, even if its right there at the bottom
    of that hole, that it can, like, always...
  - Lets go over there, write it down, it changes shape.
  - Okay, now were done with this.
  - Where do I put it?
  - Thats it.
  - Oh, my God!
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Then...
  - Wow, thats scary.
  - Put it on... or well make this mass bigger.
  - Good morning, lets get out of here.
  - Is it going a little slower?
  - Oh, yeah, I got it.
  - Lets see.
  - Is that the same speed?
  - Lets make it small.
  - Its going slower.
  - Are we going slower or is it the same?
  - No, it looks slower, but is it slower?
  - Maybe a little, its slower.
  - Its slower.
  - Thats the way it is.
  - Hey, we can.
  - Yeah, the mass of the skater...
  - Who are we taking?
  - Should this be the same?
  - Its a sickly fast.
  - If the mass is bigger, itll travel slower.
  - Lets track the energy from that way.
  - Yeah, well, maybe we should put some weight on it.
  - I know.
  - So that energy is much greater.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Im not going to.
  - What more mass?
  - Lets go play Finnish.
  - I know.
  - Thats it.
  - The point.
  - Wasnt that it? Its not growing.
  - Im not.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Yeah, when its kind of... yeah.
  - How skater... well, it slows down with the mass.
  - What?
  - Hey, whats up?
  - What?
  - So it was at its fastest...
  - Nine.
  - Nine points nine
  - Its the same thing.
  - Its not the same.
  - So, what, were gonna put this in here and have energy?
  - But the energy is greater.
  - Well, there you go.
  - But the speed doesnt change.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
  - Yeah, somehow I figured that was that speed.
  - What?
  - Its not gonna change.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Thats despite the weight.
  - Lets put something on a regular skateboard, put some 50 pounds on it.
  - Its probably early, Id say.
  - Well, thats it.
  - Its the beginning and the end, isnt it?
  - Thats business energy.
  - First vis in potential energy
  - Its the same thing at the beginning and the end, I think.
  - Its always like that on those ends.
  - Its power.
  - At the beginning and the end.
  - And the power supply down there again.
  - At the beginning and the end.
  - And then that moving energy down there.
  - Thats pretty much it.
  - Is that so low?
  - Or down there?
  - Do you want me to put the bars down or something?
  - And then they...
  - Well, business energy, if thats what it was...
  - Down there.
  - And then the next answer is that when its kind of halfway between.
  - The potential for movement is the same.
  - Yeah, when theyre about halfway there.
  - Theyre not exactly the same now, but it kind of comes in halfway.
  - Halfway between what?
  - Halfway down there?
  - Well, its not like...
  - In the middle of the night...
  - I think halfway.
  - Halfway down, the address.
  - What the hell...
  - You can put that on that girl.
  - You want to write?
  - Im not.
  - Its a short one.
  - Or its also a climb, or a hill in the middle.
  - The ramp...
  - Or sit if you cant say "midway ramp", then midway down and up.
  - If you put the drop in half and get up, thats how it goes.
  - And maybe the shortest.
  - Halfway down and up.
  - I guess thats the same thing.
  - Could it be up and down?
  - No, it doesnt look like it...
  - And so the whole energy stays the same.
  - Halfway through what?
  - Up and down.
  - So whats that?
  - What did I say at the beginning?
  - I mean, up and down...
  - As you go up and down.
  - Get up and down.
  - Is that the same energy all the time?
  - Its not gonna change.
  - Yeah, I did, by the way.
  - The overall energy is unchanged.
  - Lets put it there.
  - Its slowing down a little.
  - Its not going all the way up.
  - Its starting to run out of steam.
  - Thats how it starts.
  - Slow down and stop.
  - Slow down, slow down, and stop.
  - But the energy stays the same.
  - But its going to get heat energy at the same time.
  - If you put that in there, the kinetic and potential energy disappears and the
    heat energy is generated.
  - Or heat energy replaces motion and potential energy.
  - The total energy is kept
  - Heat and potential energy are converted into heat energy.
  - Theyre slowly decreasing and the heat energy is rising.
  - Its quietly being replaced by thermal energy.
  - That may indicate that
  - Its called a...
  - You want to fix it?
  - Its a replacement, in a way.
  - Its replaced by thermal energy.
  - I wrote all the energy in that right now.
  - Yeah, I guess not that...
  - Well, Ella wants you to direct it.
  - I mean, its not like Im...
  - ...skieter to the ramp.
  - First, set the skater to the mass...
  - ...a little bit of value.
  - Well, then, put some small value into the mass.
  - Well, 40 though.
  - 40? - What?
  - Well, probably even smaller.
  - What?
  - Oh, yeah, yeah.
  - If I had to put the first small one on.
  - Yeah, well, then well just put this on the ramp.
  - Then well take the skateboard to the ramp.
  - And there was no scratch.
  - Oh, thats good.
  - Is it going on like this forever?
  - Hes a little shy.
  - Now, get that mass out of there.
  - Slowly, and then you press that arrow.
  - Even if its 10 kilos at a time.
  - Its slowing down, or what happens to it?
  - Nothing yet, you know.
  - You just keep it down, and well see what happens.
  - Well, it stays the same.
  - It stays the same.
  - Good afternoon, all right.
  - Thats what you write.
  - Its not changing.
  - Anyone want to write with a cellular manuscript that they can find out about?
  - I dont have one.
  - Well, lets get out of here.
  - I can try.
  - Thats it.
  - I can try.
  - No change, you know.
  - Not in that one.
  - Yeah, lets get this out of here.
  - All right, then.
  - ...and then that...
  - ...you change the mass now, then you see it.
  - Move it. Move it. Move it.
  - Good, good, good. - Its growing up.
  - ...the skitters mass is increasing.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Now, step back up there a little bit.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Its power.
  - Eiku didnt take anything.
  - The mass of the skater...
  - ...when he was growing up.
  - The total energy increases with mass.
  - Yes, you are.
  - I know.
  - According to the mass.
  - Put the weight down to just a little bit...
  - ...and so much more...
  - ...isnt it faster now?
  - How can I?
  - Its faster.
  - The speed slows down as the mass grows.
  - What speed?
  - The term "eight speed" is correct.
  - The speed...
  - Oh, my God, now that manuscripts gone, its just...
  - Its not...
  - ...thats not our problem.
  - Youll find out.
  - Speed slows down as the mass increases.
  - Yeah, shit.
  - Keep it the same.
  - Lets just put it over the line and...
  - ...for the sake of the good.
  - The speed is unchanged.
  - Yeah, it just seemed like when we were in a relationship...
  - I know.
  - ...change the size of that old man.
  - Fifty.
  - Somebody, can we get a more radical...
  - ...lets take the 70s, shall we?
  - I know.
  - Early 80s.
  - Im not going to...
  - Well, then.
  - Its up there.
  - Well, thats it.
  - Its upstairs, its obvious.
  - High potential.
  - Wheres the power? Is it on the ground?
  - Down at the bottom.
  - I know.
  - The energy in the whole thing stays clear.
  - Its like halfway between going from top to bottom.
  - The business, the business, the potential...
  - Well, very close.
  - ...energy, as large as...
  - ...on the way down.
  - Or up.
  - Halfway between, halfway between the fields... or...
  - So what the fuck is that?
  - Im sorry about that.
  - So youre just gonna put something in the middle of the floor or above?
  - Im not sure.
  - Halfway through.
  - Thats it.
  - Stay with me.
  - It stays the same.
  - What dog?
  - Thats right.
  - All right, thats good.
  - The speed of the skateboard doesnt keep up.
  - What?
  - Im going to hop.
  - Oh, my God.
  - The speed of the skater...
  - ... stops and...
  - ...a little quiet.
  - Heat energy always rises as the flow slows.
  - Well, energy is converted to heat energy.
  - Yeah, its a sharp one.
  - ...the bitter taste is causing heat.
  - Well, thats the way it is.
  - Keep it the same.
  - Keep it.
  - When Im drunk, I dont remember writing...
  - ...the whole energy...
  - The total energy is maintained...
  - Oh, thats a great word.
  - ...as usual.
  - No, I guess I should put it there...
  - There you go.
  - Skitter up there so we can see how it goes back and forth.
  - But when it moves
  - But well see, and you can lift it.
  - Don t move.
  - Theres a stop-up thing down there if you want to get it.
  - The Jeep
  - Heres what it looks like.
  - The Toiko is over there.
  - the mass to a small
  - Well, why dont we try this little one and...
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Time is slowly passing
  - Yeah, I know.
  - And there was no bitterness here.
  - Other
  - Should you take it?
  - But its slowing down, sir.
  - It may not even slow down.
  - Well, it didnt speed up.
  - ♪ Move it around ♪
  - Oh, thats what it was supposed to do.
  - Its going slower, or its going the same way.
  - Its black, too.
  - It doesn t matter what the mass is.
  - Im not.
  - Yeah, because if you dont, youre not gonna get it.
  - So, what?
  - How about this?
  - Is there a speed somewhere?
  - Where the view someone...
  - Well, without the hammer, it doesn t seem to work.
  - Well, it doesn t seem like it.
  - If it does, its so small that it doesnt... well, it doesnt.
  - Whats the total energy?
  - Well, do we have to ask that Earth what the total energy is?
  - And then you write it down.
  - Oh, my God.
  - I know.
  - What factors affect you in a system size?
  - Well, thats the mass, but just when we didnt have the bitterness.
  - We can also ask if it affects...
  - Mass entirely.
  - But Im sure, but do they affect you that much?
  - Well, then, we can ask both of them.
  - Yes, I did.
  - The total energy.
  - Its a terrible touch, used to Mac.
  - Yes, I did.
  - So gravity, but its not going to be the vis...
  - Looks like this.
  - It would seem that you are going down because you come from above and gravity
    wants to bring it down, but I dont know if its about total energy now.
  - Maybe its not that way.
  - Youre being a liar!
  - What was that?
  - And then the mechanical energy is the sum of them.
  - So much energy that you have that energy pool all the time?
  - Its got...
  - I dont know, I dont know.
  - All of it.
  - I think thats the sum of the energy thats.
  - Well, I dont think that mass is necessarily what it is, because if you think
    about that kind of thing, you know, all the pieces are affected by the same gravitational
    force as their mass.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Well, the overall energy doesnt change.
  - It doesnt seem to have any effect on the speed of the car.
  - I mean, this isnt really fast.
  - So, to the point where youve brought...
  - Yeah, thats when its... so that...
  - In total energy, I guess...
  - Its a little something.
  - Lets put it what you said.
  - So, yes, but it was really the idea that compared to the fact that its so small
    and then its so big, what can you say about total energy?
  - So that to that... so if that mass doesnt seem to be that strong, then I guess
    that total energy stays the same.
  - I know.
  - I guess thats it.
  - Lets just keep the whole energy going.
  - Lets keep going.
  - I guess thats what its all about.
  - Yeah, wasnt it just that it stayed the same?
  - Just when you can see if it stays?
  - Is that what...
  - Well, it is so...
  - When it doesnt...
  - Look, its not changing size.
  - Yeah, its a little weird.
  - Yeah, its a little confusing, but its like...
  - Yeah, its not that...
  - Its going to be exactly the same.
  - Im not.
  - All right, all right.
  - Its the same.
  - Its not gonna change.
  - Lets just say that
  - The speed of the skater stays the same.
  - I know.
  - Should I take this regardless of the mass?
  - Why, it doesnt affect it.
  - Well, just that when youre here, thats regardless of the mass.
  - Yeah, well, thats it, so were out of here.
  - Ill put a ton of slow down and slow down.
  - Yeah, its all over that top.
  - The highest point.
  - Whats the word that says, "Im...
  - You know, its a bit like...
  - Because thats where youve come from and youre going back.
  - But is that the right word for "point"?
  - Should I make those things a little bigger?
  - I put it on, but its not... not the bigger one, its the witches.
  - Not when its so out of place that you can see them better.
  - But thats easier.
  - I mean, well see better if were put like this.
  - There you go, turn up.
  - Yes, I did.
  - I mean, can you put it up there, up the ramp...
  - The potential energy
  - Where the direction of movement changes.
  - ...is at its peak...
  - Im going to turn the ramp.
  - Like someone upstairs, where the direction of movement changes.
  - No, Im not.
  - Ill put it upstairs where...
  - Move it up.
  - Its right in the middle.
  - Yeah, really, really low.
  - Down there.
  - You have to put it on.
  - You need to make a move.
  - Youre gonna have to move.
  - Its got to start there and then its gone.
  - Well, its there anyway.
  - Its right there.
  - Its in there.
  - Yes, it is.
  - I dont know. Is that a bit of a sting?
  - There you go.
  - Right in the middle of the ramp.
  - The move.
  - Its power.
  - Theres a ramp at the top.
  - ..in the middle of the...
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Youre swimming pretty well.
  - Its in the middle.
  - So the ramps in the middle.
  - When its coming up.
  - Do you care if its going down?
  - So, what?
  - Is there any way to explain that when the skater leaves that...
  - When the skater...
  - When a skater is either coming or going...
  - Its like...
  - Either up to the center or from the center to the other edge.
  - Or something like that.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Is that right?
  - From above.
  - But its not a little bit of a middle ground when its a little...
  - The page of the...
  - Ram, what are you doing?
  - Its like a ton...
  - The center of the ramp page.
  - Yeah, well, the total energy and the business energy.
  - Where are those spots in the middle?
  - I wonder if it is.
  - I mean, like, like, like...
  - Yeah, well, not exactly like that.
  - I was talking about it in the middle of it, and when its real like that...
  - Oh, theres the center.
  - Its like down there.
  - There it is.
  - Halfway through and...
  - Im going to ramp up and down the side.
  - So between the top and bottom of the ramp.
  - Halfway down the hill.
  - Can you put it in the middle of the ramp page?
  - Because you brought the bottom and the pages.
  - The page of the ramp...
  - Or halfway between the starting point and the bottom.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Im going to the ramp.
  - Halfway through...
  - I just had to write.
  - Im not.
  - Is that what brought it together?
  - Yes, I did.
  - Can you put...
  - Can you shrink it?
  - But youre gonna lower the odds?
  - Because its not completely visible now, it brought in total energy.
  - So were not gonna live the mass?
  - So what?
  - Thats it.
  - That it shows it completely.
  - Thats it.
  - It stays the same.
  - The total energy stays the same.
  - Was that a ton of weight?
  - It doesnt seem like anything.
  - So the greater the mass, the greater the total energy, right?
  - But it stays the same all the time.
  - Yes, you are.
  - Shall we just put this...
  - So well set the energy to the same level the whole way.
  - ..the woman
  - ..energy
  - Were in the introductory section now.
  - The energy stays the same.
  - Im not going to.
  - Should we put a little or a lot?
  - A little bit.
  - A little bit.
  - I guess thats good.
  - And then what happens?
  - Whats going on?
  - Well, now were going to get heat power.
  - Isnt that the top?
  - There you go.
  - Thats the same spot.
  - And the heat energy rises when it rises.
  - Always like that.
  - When I get up.
  - But what did he bring?
  - But does it keep getting so much slower?
  - I was looking at it.
  - Doesnt it look like youre not going that fast?
  - The speed of the skateboarder is slowing.
  - Its slowing down.
  - Good afternoon.
  - Its like its not going up like this.
  - No, not like that.
  - Thats how it stops completely.
  - It stops at the bottom.
  - Thats right.
  - If I have to make them a little smaller, youll see youre not the red one.
  - Its not even that far from the other side.
  - But its just a continuous increase.
  - Im not.
  - It keeps growing.
  - Thats how it grows from the beginning.
  - Heat is rising.
  - Heat energy is rising.
  - Lets start with that.
  - Yeah, its been like that all along.
  - Yes, of course.
  - The heat is rising, but the speed is slowing.
  - So, is that gonna increase the total energy, too?
  - Its growing.
  - Oh, yeah.
  - Well, the kinetic energy and the potential energy are diminishing.
  - Its getting smaller.
  - When the journey slows down, or something.
  - Or when the speed slows down
  - Movement
  - The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of this
    Regulation.
  - But doesnt the compound energy stay the same?
  - Stay with me.
  - Yes, you are.
  - Its not gonna change.
  - So, probably somewhere after the moment when you brought the business energy.
  - Im not sure the heat is going to go away.
  - The same amount as when you brought it all together.
  - Yeah, lets try the giant and the giant weight.
  - I wonder if the change will come any faster.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - The cat
  - Im sure its true when youre...
  - It stays the same all the time.
  - Yeah, so somewhere the heat energy reaches the point where its not the only energy
    thats there.
  - It takes a little bit of kinetic energy and potential energy out of that place.
  - I put in motion energy and potential energy to decrease as motion slows down.
  - Yes, I did.
  - The total energy is unchanged
  - Its 60 pounds now, which is probably less.
  - Hes not staying.
  - Put a little massage on it.
  - No gravity, you know.
  - No gravity, when what, mass.
  - Its there.
  - Yes, I did.
  - I know.
  - Hows it go that high?
  - Its slower.
  - Its going to the same height...
  - ...but its much slower.
  - I did.
  - Just make it bigger.
  - Its going to be the same.
  - Its halfway through.
  - So its gonna stay that way for the worst.
  - Its just that...
  - ...that speed changes.
  - Its slowing down.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Can you just put that...
  - ...is it going to affect you?
  - Yeah, does it affect you at all, or does it go the same way?
  - The energy of movement, the energy of potential...
  - If I change like this.
  - Is there anyone else out there?
  - Its getting smaller.
  - Its going to shrink.
  - ...yes, yes, it grows with the mass.
  - Its power.
  - The powers rising.
  - All energy, but then those potential and kinetic energy are the same thing?
  - So we cant cover this...
  - ...that its going to be the same.
  - The living business energy is greater than...
  - ...and thats how it grows.
  - So as the mass increases, so does the energy.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Yeah, well, write it like that.
  - I mean, when the mass increases.
  - And yes, as the mass increases, so does the energy.
  - Yeah, the mass increases, the total energy increases?
  - Yeah, I guess.
  - Yeah, well, its like both of those energies are growing up at the same rate...
  - ...it seems like a whole lot of energy.
  - Thats when the potential energy is the highest.
  - What can we say about that?
  - There is such a thing.
  - Its made up of motion and potential energy...
  - ...which are as big as were in this situation.
  - You did?
  - Its the same size here.
  - Its made up of the same size.
  - ...lets just make sure its made up of these.
  - Its made up of the same size.
  - Thats it.
  - Potential and business energy.
  - I know.
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - This one.
  - Now, if youre gonna make it bigger or smaller.
  - So if it does happen...
  - Its always down there.
  - 30 pounds, thats what it is.
  - But if we lift it.
  - Well, it stays the same, brought speed.
  - The energy increases with mass, of course, but the velocity stays the same.
  - Thats how we keep the speed.
  - No matter how small.
  - Ill keep the speed down.
  - Well answer that we wont change.
  - So the speed is the highest...
  - At the bottom of the ramp.
  - Speed is the highest at the bottom of the ramp.
  - And of course its a break, it even goes to zero the speed it breaks when it turns.
  - Mm, because thats it.
  - Potential energy.
  - And the smaller one.
  - Theres no such thing.
  - Theres a ramp.
  - On the edge of it.
  - Or in the head.
  - He went to the edges.
  - I wonder what happens if I take this.
  - Lets take 50.
  - Theres the fastest moving energy at the bottom, so theres no potential energy.
  - So, all right.
  - Its up there.
  - Its right here where it stops.
  - Well, I guess its going to be zero.
  - Were down to zero.
  - Its pretty much legal now.
  - Im on the edge of the ramp at zero speed.
  - Meters in seconds.
  - As fast as you can.
  - Is it smaller or zero?
  - Because I do.
  - Itll stop there completely.
  - Were down to zero.
  - Yeah, the potential energy is bigger.
  - Its right down there.
  - Is that going to zero?
  - It doesnt necessarily work.
  - Its probably so fast, itll just happen.
  - Now, nine points.
  - 2 is the fastest.
  - But Im afraid its going fast.
  - Its probably in between now and ready to go.
  - ...there.
  - Is this halfway through?
  - Halfway through, the other ones gonna be on the line.
  - Halfway down the floor, and...
  - Youve done a pretty good job of stopping the fire.
  - I used to.
  - Halfway down, and the ramps over.
  - Because if you put the halfway point, its not there.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Can we say it stays the same?
  - And as the potential energy goes up, so the kinetic energy goes down, and vice
    versa.
  - Because if the total energy is absorbed...
  - It stays the same.
  - It stays the same.
  - ...so its not moving at all.
  - Get out of there.
  - Not when youre on the ramp.
  - Im gonna have to, okay?
  - Where do we put it?
  - Thats it.
  - Oh, yeah, we should be, yeah.
  - Just put it back to normal now, and Ill see you around.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Well, its not going up that high now, its slowing down.
  - And then it...
  - Its like that all the time.
  - ...slow down the speed and finally stop.
  - And the heat energy came into play...
  - Yeah, because its itchy.
  - ...because its bitter.
  - Okay, so whats the skateboard?
  - And then it stops.
  - It will eventually.
  - Itll stop, of course.
  - Its good to stay on the skateboard.
  - A little bit of a stiffness, though.
  - Yeah, thats the one.
  - ...and youre going to do that in your place without any speed, then its time.
  - I lifted that ceiling.
  - Well, the energy of movement...
  - ...and potentially energy.
  - Do they count all the time?
  - Lets put it back up there.
  - Theyre getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller
    and smaller.
  - I dont think theyre going to go up that high anymore.
  - Yes, the total energy stays the same.
  - Because its moving into thermal energy, thats potential and kinetic energy.
  - Okay, so its business energy and potential energy.
  - Theyre getting smaller and smaller, arent they?
  - Yeah, I mean, fairly, yeah.
  - And the heat energy...
  - Its the same.
  - ...and then they turn into thermal energy.
  - The smaller one.
  - You know, you...
  - ...shrinking.
  - Thats right.
  - And they turn into thermal energy.
  - It stays the same.
  - Its like, depending on the altitude it changes to, but...
  - ...yo, here it stays the same.
  - I wonder what it was.
  - Lets put 25.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - Its a pretty small skateboard.
  - Its a time-honored rooftop.
  - You gotta get that skater to skate.
  - Shall we put it on hold?
  - Put it on.
  - Okay, so, what do you say we put 10 or 5 pounds at a time?
  - Put a ten, youll see the difference.
  - Then you can raise 15 by the next one.
  - Maybe it is.
  - Its accelerating faster than its going, but its also accelerating faster than
    its going.
  - So its accelerating negatively and positively, more slowly.
  - Lets see.
  - Even now, its going to go off, but its going off when its really fast.
  - It stays the same, yeah.
  - Its an illusion.
  - That they stay the same.
  - Yeah, because its going up the same way.
  - The overall energy stays the same.
  - Whats that?
  - I know.
  - Yes, you are.
  - If I had to count on that...
  - One of them.
  - ...it wont stay in the race.
  - Oh, what?
  - Are they gonna stay the same now or...
  - Theyll stay the same.
  - So thats the same potential energy every time it goes up the same height.
  - Yes, I did.
  - So the potential energy stays the same.
  - Im not going to.
  - It just happens to be kinetic every now and then.
  - But its really going to accelerate, because its...
  - Or
  - Yeah, thats a change of pace, but...
  - But its there at the end of it, and its much faster at the beginning.
  - But its gonna accelerate there.
  - Its going to accelerate, but the total energy is still the same.
  - No, because it just means that that potential energy is moving against, but more.
  - The kinetic energy was that...
  - Yeah, yeah, it has that potential all the time.
  - So much more of that potential is kinetic.
  - Well, it accelerates as it descends, slows down as it ascends.
  - So the speed increases as it drops.
  - Yeah, and its slowing down.
  - Well, that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.
  - And then when it comes up, that kinetic energy changes the potential energy again.
  - But isnt that just the fact that...
  - Well, because... well, I guess thats a long answer.
  - I can do that.
  - Because the earth pulls the cat towards it, and the cats potential energy is
    converted into kinetic energy as it decreases.
  - And then again, when the cat goes up a mountain, the cats kinetic energy changes
    potentially.
  - Could explain in principle, in such a long way
  - Yeah, if you put that down to what happens.
  - But its not...
  - Ask him why he...
  - Oh, well, ask me, well, lets try.
  - Why does speed increase when you fall?
  - What do you think thats going to be?
  - We can ask a further question if he wants to.
  - Im sure its enter.
  - If you put it on
  - Gravity is working.
  - Yeah, it seems like a long time.
  - Or have had a longer period of influence on the lower
  - The Jeep
  - Because...
  - The gravity...
  - Well, if gravity had been able to affect the skater for longer,
  - Im not going to.
  - Yeah, that roofs going up.
  - ..have been...
  - It seems...
  - The slide.
  - ...for a while.
  - Whats the matter with you?
  - Its about to be 60 pounds, right?
  - I know.
  - Its just so realistic.
  - So, up there.
  - So we can see that it doesnt change that energy.
  - The potential energy is the greatest up there.
  - Right, thats right.
  - I mean, its exciting.
  - But well write it up.
  - And too much energy in the bottom.
  - But it comes down to this point in principle.
  - But, you know,
  - Yes, I did.
  - But thats it.
  - Yeah, the mass of the skater affects the energy, it doesnt.
  - Yes, I did.
  - a) the following
  - No, the mass is not.
  - Im not going to.
  - So those answers were there.
  - Yeah, it was.
  - This is the answer. You have to put it here like this.
  - That how potential energy affects... achieves...
  - Well, what were gonna answer to this is how its gonna work.
  - That doesnt seem to be the case.
  - No effect on energy
  - Im just wondering if we can just put it on the floor and make sure it doesnt
    affect the energy.
  - Well, you can move that slider now, but it probably wont work.
  - I mean, yeah, it doesnt seem like it.
  - Yes, but it doesn t affect the energy.
  - It doesnt even affect the energy.
  - Not in isolation, but in general.
  - That you put... in a... in a... in a skateboard...
  - Isnt that up there?
  - Its up there.
  - Upstairs, please.
  - No, not them.
  - Im not going to number them.
  - I know.
  - No, not them.
  - Theyre not even numbers.
  - Well, I dont know.
  - Im not living.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Im not.
  - The momentum is at its greatest.
  - Well, get down there.
  - It makes perfect sense that they should be the same size in that half.
  - Well, try it.
  - Its losing the other one now that its not moving.
  - Im just so excited that when you put it on the water, itll go to the same place.
  - Not when youre not.
  - Because its...
  - ♪ Take it and smirk it in ♪
  - But theyre in the middle of it anyway.
  - Its right in the middle of it.
  - Yeah, halfway through.
  - What about the size?
  - Theyre the same size, how do you put it like this...
  - ...that the halfway point doesnt mean that when its down there.
  - But then...
  - In the middle?
  - Down the middle and up the middle.
  - The mountains.
  - Im not.
  - In the middle of the mountains.
  - Yeah, lets just put it on, I dont think you need it that way.
  - Im not.
  - It doesnt stay the same when its the same time.
  - Its not gonna change.
  - There you go.
  - Put a number on it.
  - Or put it in the middle.
  - Thats it, you see.
  - All right, you skater.
  - Slowing down all the time.
  - Its going to be moving energy, heat energy in the brick.
  - Yeah, but for a skater, its slowing down all the time.
  - And then...
  - And then it stops.
  - Yeah, its not going up.
  - Yeah, so its slowing down all the time.
  - Yeah, I mean, yeah.
  - Thats it.
  - Put it there.
  - You could put that
  - Well, tell me what you think.
  - That the skateboarding movement is slowing down
  - Until it stops.
  - Thats it.
  - And then it stops.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Put it back on the roll, so...
  - Ill see you in the next one.
  - Well, theyre always small...
  - And the movement and the potential energy is diminishing.
  - So that heat energy grows rapidly when the motion energy is not in.
  - Lets see if we can...
  - Its almost full of kinetic energy in thermal energy right up there.
  - And youre not gonna get the heat energy...
  - But try... put it up there.
  - What?
  - That cat again.
  - Lets just get rid of whatever moves are more important.
  - You keep the energy in the air.
  - Heat energy changes rapidly, too.
  - But can you put it in that...
  - What? - What?
  - Heat energy...
  - Or it turns that energy into the most heat energy when its the most kinetic energy.
  - Its a very clear difference that when...
  - The power of movement...
  - When you have this horrible swipe...
  - When the business energy...
  - The most?
  - So this...
  - When the power is at its warmest...
  - The energy...
  - The fastest energy growth
  - When business energy is at its highest
  - Heat
  - The energy...
  - Growing fastest
  - The total energy...
  - ♪ Im not a woman ♪
  - There was nothing on the other side of the room.
  - Put it on the massage.
  - What?
  - Put it right there.
  - You can probably grab that blue and water it in there.
  - Good luck. Now, grab that skateboard.
  - And put it back in there, and well disappear.
  - Wait till it stops.
  - Well, lets just get out of here. What happens when you raise that mass?
  - You can split the dough in half next time.
  - Oh, the van, it started going...
  - Faster than that.
  - And put the ties back up there.
  - Do you want me to increase the total energy?
  - Yeah, thats a little bit...
  - So it moves... so thats how the total reward moves.
  - Yeah, the total is growing.
  - We could even make a dog out of a character.
  - Maybe we wont change.
  - That its...
  - That it depends on the mass.
  - All right, lets put that on.
  - I know.
  - Ask him if the mass has an effect on the total energy.
  - Or something.
  - Or how mass affects the total energy.
  - I saw it.
  - But we can assume that mass affects that energy.
  - The total energy is connected to...
  - Somehow, I did.
  - I know.
  - Well, put the little mass on.
  - It got smaller, thats the whole character.
  - I mean, I...
  - Should we put it back there?
  - No, it must have taken it.
  - Or was it past?
  - Im gonna make it big now, and Im gonna...
  - If, like this...
  - Its not changed.
  - Its not changed.
  - Lets get it on.
  - Lets put it that way.
  - Lets make a deal.
  - Thats it.
  - And all the way up.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Put on 50 pounds.
  - Thats it.
  - Up there.
  - Always up there.
  - Its that blue prize.
  - I did.
  - But the potential energy is always there.
  - I think so.
  - Yeah, because its that energy thats stored, so when its in place, then its...
  - Ill put that when the skaters in place, thats at the top of the ramp.
  - Well, thats probably it, but you cant see it in here.
  - You can slow it down a little.
  - No, thats green, but its also a break.
  - So low in the whistle.
  - Im sure you can move it over there...
  - Down here?
  - Theres no energy in that.
  - Ill move it a little bit more.
  - Where are we gonna move it?
  - Go ahead. - What?
  - Help me with this.
  - Theres no movement energy now that its not moving.
  - No, but when it comes up, just... put it on.
  - Put the pause down, put the slow one down.
  - Its always down there.
  - The bottom of the line.
  - Yeah, the bottom of the line.
  - I cant draw these arrows anymore.
  - Its business.
  - Im not going to.
  - Thats just too little text there.
  - Answer him I dont want to.
  - Well, then, at that point, all that potential energy has turned into kinetic energy,
    but I dont know how.
  - It just changes.
  - This is what happened.
  - Yeah, lets move it in there.
  - Right there.
  - Thats the point, that halfway point, naked trip.
  - Yes, it is.
  - Down and up on the way.
  - No, Im not.
  - Somewhere, always.
  - It was like halfway up and down towards me.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Up and down.
  - Im sure we can ask that from the MAI.
  - Im gonna ask you how long weve spent on this mission.
  - That theres a clock?
  - You put it in there and well disappear.
  - Hit that pause button.
  - Its the same thing all the time, because theyre different.
  - I see.
  - But that means that the whole time that number is constant.
  - Heat energy, sharp.
  - Okay, yeah, and we dont have that bitterness right now.
  - Yeah, well, it doesnt change, of course. It kind of changes shape.
  - Put some...
  - The halfway point
  - And then...
  - Put the skater on the ramp.
  - Lets put it out of here.
  - What happens to the skater?
  - Well, its slowing down.
  - Its accelerating.
  - Eikus speed is slowing down.
  - And that keeps rising.
  - That energy stays...
  - Is there heat coming in now?
  - Yeah, its going up.
  - Look at that.
  - Who gets up all the time.
  - When the kinetic energy and that other energy decrease, thats when it grows in
    the same proportion.
  - And suddenly its that whole energy.
  - Yeah, hes going up and down in turns.
  - Can it somehow put the heat energy to increase in the same ratio while the other
    two decrease?
  - And its all converted into a common energy?
  - Is it true that the total energy content remains the same but that the kinetic
    energy and potential energy are converted into thermal energy?
  - I know.
  - Well, lets just say that the kinetic energy and the potential energy...
  - They are converted to thermal energy.
  - Im putting this on for the sting.
  - And the total energy content will remain the same.
  - Yes, you are.
- intent: Task definition
  examples:
  - Check out the selections at the start of the simulation.
  - ... to variables and possibilities.
  - ...to the core concepts
  - In the rock.
  - In the rock.
  - Put none of them on the ice and put the skater on the ramp.
  - Is the mass of the skater very small?
  - If you set the largest mass options for the skater.
  - So number one doesnt bite.
  - Yeah, thats a small amount.
  - Im gonna have a skateboard on the ramp and some low-key mass.
  - Yeah, lets see.
  - You can get it.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Lets try that little mass.
  - Can you put this in there?
  - Like theres no bitterness in it.
  - No, its not.
  - If we add more, well be fine.
  - Im not going to.
  - So dont get me started on anything.
  - Did you ever say that all this energy,
  - Those skates have changed. Why?
  - How does the mass of a skater affect the energy?
  - And then theres what can you say about total energy?
  - And the third question was,
  - How does the speed of the skater change and why?
  - How does the speed of a skater change, and why?
  - If you raise that mass,
  - So how does that speed change, and why?
  - Oh, my God.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Number two.
  - Keep it going. Don t pick anything regular on the skater.
  - Study the potential energy and the mobility energy sizes differently
  - You can use a pause to ease the pain.
  - I mean, keep it.
  - some mass of it full
  - Find the point where the potential energy reaches the largest possible orc.
  - To find a point where the potential energy reaches the highest possible value,
    at the top of the ramp.
  - Find the point where the kinetic energy reaches its maximum value.
  - Next, were going to find a place where the kinetic energy and the potential energy
    are equal.
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Then bite.
  - Put the grit higher than none and put the skater on the ramp.
  - So what happens to the energies, and why?
  - Whats the conclusion of the simulation?
  - Im sure if hes scrolling down, there might be someone there.
  - I think so.
  - Kato, theres a box in there.
  - What?
  - Put it on.
  - The first sentence
  - Thats it.
  - I know.
  - Now, this first ones probably gonna bite.
  - Im not.
  - Im gonna put the skateboard on the ramp.
  - Put it first.
  - A little bit of value in the mass of a skater.
  - How does mass affect energy?
  - What can you say?
  - But...
  - What brought the energy
  - Whats the power apple on the left?
  - Im not going to.
  - So what can you say about total energy?
  - Here, its like the whole energy.
  - What is a square and a zero level
  - Thats the bottom left.
  - So how does the speed of the skater change, and why?
  - Keep it sharp in the regulations.
  - You can pick a regular massage drink.
  - Explore potential energy and transport energy
  - The size of the ramp at different points.
  - Down, up in the middle.
  - You can use a break.
  - The point at which the potential energy reaches its maximum value.
  - Its the potential energy.
  - Then, when the transportation industry reaches its highest...
  - Then the transportation energy and potential energy are equal?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Okay, put the bit higher than none.
  - And put the skater on the ramp.
  - Whats going on, skateboarder?
  - A lot of it.
  - I had to put this one as big as none.
  - Yeah, yeah, what happens to the energies, and why?
  - Now take it down.
  - The whole energy.
  - Im sure youll find it true.
  - Is this the energy drink?
  - I guess its a little bit of a mess.
  - Im going to get you.
  - Should we go straight or go somewhere?
  - Lets get to the point.
  - Dont make it hard on me.
  - Not when I had to go to the playground.
  - No, Im not.
  - Thats it.
  - Not when they were skating.
  - Its just something you can edit.
  - Put the skater on the ramp.
  - First, set a small value for the mass of the skater, and then gradually increase
    it.
  - Theres a mass there.
  - How the mass of the skater affects the energy.
  - Now Im not getting this skater off tonight.
  - Is there any way to shut it down here?
  - I can do it, I guess.
  - What if... at some point...
  - Hey, can I change a skater for a dog?
  - Not here, not here.
  - How does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - And how does the speed of the skater change, and why?
  - Is there anything that you need to put this at...
  - ...this meter?
  - Now were not gonna show this here anymore.
  - So the question is, what can you say about total energy?
  - Then it was that what can you say about total energy?
  - The energy.
  - What do you say we make that cat a skateboarder?
  - I know.
  - I dont need to change that skateboard now?
  - So, how does the speed of the skater change, and why?
  - Whats the speed on this?
  - Theres nothing in here.
  - Well, thats...
  - ...that speed.
  - Keep it sharp in the regulations.
  - And then...
  - Choose a standard one.
  - Choose something thats already standard for the skater.
  - Check the potential energy and kinetic energy levels at different points on the
    ramp.
  - Down, up, in the middle.
  - I know.
  - Can you use the pauses to facilitate surveillance?
  - Its like youre really getting a break from it.
  - Yeah, there is.
  - And then look for the point where the potential energy reaches the highest possible
    value.
  - Find a spot where theres potential energy.
  - And the highest point is the one where the momentum reaches its maximum value.
  - Then find a point where the kinetic energy and the potential energy are equal.
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Put the grit higher than none and put the skater on the ramp.
  - Its a skate park.
  - Is that the first skate park?
  - Yeah, its just the same questions here.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - I know.
  - Then the skater to the ramp...
  - ...and a little value in the skeletons mass...
  - ...and gradually raise it higher.
  - I dont think its a bit of a whim.
  - Okay, lets go in there and take a picture.
  - A small amount of weight...
  - ...and then gradually raise it to a larger size.
  - Its a small mass.
  - No itching, and then well gradually raise it.
  - Okay, then we have to...
  - ...and now its probably there when you move it, you can see what energy...
  - ...can you see?
  - How does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - When you press that energy on the left, do you get that energy from there?
  - I know.
  - Oh, you can change it.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Im going to get it.
  - What can you say...
  - ...the whole energy?
  - You can see it from the right, you can see the speed.
  - Youll click it from up there.
  - There.
  - They dont put a stick in it, but its probably in the next one.
  - So, you did.
  - Im sure not.
  - Oh, you always put a ton of it up.
  - Every time we go to it.
  - No, I mean, why isnt it now?
  - Oh, my God.
  - There it is.
  - Keep it sharp in the regulations.
  - ...and pick something more regular for the skater.
  - Okay, so we have to pick someone.
  - Check the magnitude of the potential energy and the kinetic energy at different
    points on the ramp...
  - ...below, up, in the middle...
  - ...youre going to use a pause to facilitate observation.
  - Find the point where the potential reaches its maximum.
  - Well, look for the point where the momentum of the motion energy reaches the highest
    possible value...
  - Can you stop it?
  - Can you just put it right there?
  - But would it be based on the fact that it somehow puts its greatest potential
    energy into it?
  - No, Im not.
  - Then theres that third mission next, you dont have to put it in.
  - Bigger than none.
  - What happens to the skater?
  - Its the same here.
  - Can you point at me for a bit?
  - The dawn
  - Time is fast, dog.
  - Look at it, it can turn the other way.
  - No, Im not going to...
  - ...how do you make it stop?
  - Wee!
  - Now that guys gone.
  - Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now,
    now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now,
    now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now,
    now,
  - Im not going to.
  - ...and then...
  - The speed is at its peak.
  - ...and a lot of gravity.
  - Well, here it was, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
    you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
    you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
    you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
    you know
  - ...put the skater on the ramp and first set a small value for the skaters mass...
  - ...and then gradually raise it higher.
  - So how does skating affect energy?
  - Whats bringing the energy ladder in there?
  - Ah, the find there.
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - How does the speed of a skater change, and why?
  - What is it?
  - Keep the sharpness on the regulation at all and pick one more regular for the
    skater.
  - Check the potential energy and the kinetic energy levels at different points on
    the ramp, lower, upper, middle.
  - Yeah, and when its really down there, or theres that pause, so you can use it
    when its down...
  - Oh, where is it?
  - ...that pause is right there in the bottom of the...
  - Yes, it is.
  - I need to collect the ri--
  - ...find a point where the potential energy reaches its maximum value.
  - So... can you do it like you can move that dog in there?
  - Im going to take a break.
  - Find the point where the kinetic energy reaches its maximum value.
  - Find a point where the kinetic energy and the potential energy are equal.
  - Find a place where, perhaps the last...
  - ...what can you say, what can you say about total energy?
  - ...well, put the switch on...
  - Put the bitter one higher than none...
  - What happens to the skater?
  - Good, good, two, what happens to the energy and why?
  - It says here what you can say about total energy, and this is the third question,
    so lets just say...
  - Yeah, its coming in the last corner.
  - I know.
  - Wait, what if he read?
  - Well, no, you cant hide it like this.
  - Oh, no, lets get it on.
  - So this is the motherfucker we can use as a help.
  - I know.
  - Youre a fool.
  - What the hell?
  - Well, I havent been able to read yet
  - Lets hear it.
  - I guess not.
  - Thats the fucking thing.
  - May, please.
  - Can you hear us?
  - No, Im not.
  - Can you hear us?
  - But I mean, Im not a...
  - Can you say something?
  - I need to speak to him in the written language.
  - Before you start working on the actual simulation, please consult the selections
    in the introduction to the simulation on the variables that can be modified and
    the possibilities to illustrate the key concepts of this task.
  - Okay, so what?
  - Youre scary.
  - So, youre working on the introduction to the simulation and discussing the situations
    below 13...
  - So you saw it.
  - I know.
  - Maybe you should write questions down there on the ground.
  - First, ask the countries what kinetic energy means.
  - No, no, Im not going to.
  - Testing the wire
  - What? - What?
  - Why, what?
  - Well, lets ask him.
  - Cant you?
  - I mean, I cant?
  - All right, lets try it.
  - Yeah, lets try this.
  - What do you mean, "Im not a doctor"?
  - What? - What?
  - I was wondering if that was where it happened... okay, so, what do we do, go down
    that line?
  - Yeah, lets go with that.
  - How can you not get it?
  - Or dont put that in it yet.
  - Read this mission.
  - First, set a small value for the mass of the skater, and then raise it by degrees.
  - Can we get that off that track if we put 100...
  - Yeah, if you press that arrow.
  - Hes gonna put it on the grill, not at all, and then the skaters gonna go up
    there.
  - So whats the question, how does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - How does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - So how does it affect the energy?
  - Then heres what you can say...
  - What can you say about total energy?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - So how did the speed of the skater change and why?
  - How did the speed of the skater change, and why?
  - Keep the stick in the set, no one, and pick one for the regular skater.
  - Explore the potential
  - Check the potential energy and kinetic energy levels at different points on the
    ramp.
  - You can use a pause to facilitate observation.
  - The question is, find the point where the potential energy reaches the
  - the highest possible value.
  - Then look for the point where the kinetic energy reaches its maximum
  - Then find a place where
  - Put it up.
  - The energy efficiency and energy potential are high.
  - So what can you say about total energy?
  - All right, put the bit higher than none.
  - What happens to the skater?
  - So what energy is going on now, and why?
  - Its an energy skate park.
  - Good afternoon.
  - Its now.
  - So, isnt there a first-rate people here...
  - ...dont read it.
  - I can read it out loud from here.
  - Im not going to.
  - Wheres the parking lot?
  - There you go.
  - Imagine someone is a code-breaker.
  - Yes, I did.
  - Go to that one.
  - Wheres the sting?
  - Its the right edge. It reads big.
  - Oh, my God.
  - And put the skater on...
  - ...to the ramp.
  - First, set a small value on the mass of the skater, and then gradually increase
    it.
  - Whats that?
  - Its the force of gravity.
  - Well, thats a lot.
  - How does the mass of the skater affect the energies?
  - Can I just click on it?
  - Where do you see that energy?
  - Yeah, well, thats the plus energy there, at least on the left.
  - Put what that plus energy does.
  - In the left corner.
  - Put your left.
  - Upstairs, please.
  - Upstairs, please.
  - What happens to it?
  - Do you see it?
  - Look, it shows energy.
  - Whats it say?
  - Im not.
  - Its the energy of movement.
  - Green is potential energy.
  - Whats the question?
  - Thats it.
  - So how does the mass of the skater affect...
  - I mean, thats...
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Whats that thing in front of me...
  - So we cant ask him anything?
  - Well, I dont know, we, we...
  - Why would we ask him anything?
  - Lets test the...
  - ...to know how to answer...
  - ...and ask him if he...
  - ...why is the total energy the same all the time?
  - But what is this device in front of me?
  - Its the same.
  - So, last one, how does the speed of the skater change and why?
  - What?
  - How does the speed of a skater change, and why?
  - Good luck with two, keep the bitterness still and pick something more regular
    for the skater.
  - Adjust the potential energy and the kinetic energy levels at different points
    on the ramps...
  - ...below, up and in the middle...
  - ...youre going to use a break to facilitate your observation...
  - ...find a point where the potential energy reaches its maximum value.
  - So now the first one was where the potential reaches the highest possible value...
  - Find the point where the kinetic energy reaches its maximum value.
  - Find a point where the kinetic energy and the potential energy are equal.
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - What?
  - The next question was, what can you say about total energy?
  - Put the bitter one higher than none...
  - ...and put the skater on the ramp...
  - ...what happens to the skater?
  - What happens to the skater?
  - What happens to the energies...
  - And why?
  - What can you do?
  - Shut up, you little bitch.
  - ...what can you say about total energy?
  - So first, sharp.
  - First, he kept the introduction to the roof.
  - Theres no bitterness at all.
  - Im gonna start with a little weight for the skater ramp.
  - Wheres the mass?
  - One down there.
  - Its the force of gravity.
  - The mass is one lower.
  - There you go.
  - Is that what it is?
  - I guess it is.
  - So whats ours?
  - There it is.
  - Something of little value, degree or most.
  - How the mass of a skater affects energy.
  - We should see how it builds up.
  - Youll probably get a straight arrow from there to see if it goes every ten.
  - Not when its going to go or okay, okay.
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Whats the mass of the skater?
  - I wonder if its Finnish.
  - How does that speed change and why?
  - Its about the kinetic.
  - Its about the mechanics, yeah.
  - Im not.
  - Then...
  - We can still get it installed.
  - Lets see how the energy...
  - And down and up and in the middle
  - You can use the...
  - Now you should have the point where the potential energy reaches its maximum potential.
  - Im not.
  - Yes, I did.
  - So look for the point where the potential energy reaches the maximum value possible.
  - Then well have to look for the same thing in business energy.
  - Then find a point where the kinetic energy and the potential energy are equal.
  - Theyre the same size.
  - The energy of motion and the energy of potential are equal.
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - What happens to the energies and why
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Live there.
  - Mass and location of the skater and the area of the skater and track gauge
  - Please refer to the menus in the introduction.
  - Is this...
  - Yeah, I know.
  - So, first of all, it means that theres no...
  - Yes, I did.
  - Are they the same there?
  - Yeah, I know.
  - So the bottom line...
  - Its just a little cold, you know?
  - Well, here you go.
  - I mean, its not a bit of a joke.
  - Theres the bitterness, not at all.
  - Now put it on the ramp.
  - So, whats the weight, should I lower it?
  - A little bit of value in the mass?
  - So this is gravity.
  - This is the mass.
  - Keep the mass down.
  - I mean, what about this gravity thing?
  - Has it changed in the meantime?
  - Do you need to...
  - So were not going to have to lose sight of how the mass of the kettle affects
    the energy, but were going to start by making it bigger.
  - Does it affect the energy?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - But when its time... can you see that speed from any of these little tables?
  - Is there a speed up there, a board?
  - Then keep it sharp in the regulations. Not at all.
  - The amount of potential energy and kinetic energy
  - ... potential energy reaches the highest possible value
  - Wheres the potential energy in that?
  - Its business.
  - So take it.
  - Where theyre as big as you.
  - Where are they so big?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Then its bigger and bigger when its not.
  - Yeah, well, where do you get that lead now?
  - I mean, this is the same thing as this.
  - Yeah, but, but, but, we should.
  - Work on the introduction to the simulation.
  - Theres no lead there.
  - Im sure its here.
  - No, its going to the next one over there.
  - What?
  - The beginning.
  - Well, nothing to worry about.
  - What? - What?
  - Then you can read it here.
  - Take the questions.
  - Good luck, so now youre just pressing that lead.
  - Then what?
  - How does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - How does the speed of the skater change?
  - Hey, yeah.
  - What brings the blue?
  - Weight.
  - It was like a few of the main things were picked up from this.
  - Ill draw you one conclusion.
  - Whats the next big thing?
  - You only need to write one conclusion.
  - Thats it.
  - Of every three...
  - ...and not one of these little bugs.
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Well, then, there you go. Keep your mouth shut.
  - ...not yet in the regulations, and choose a more regular skater...
  - Find a place where...
  - ...as we explore the ramp in different directions...
  - ...up, down, in the middle...
  - ...can use a break...
  - ...find a place where...
  - ...the potential energy reaches its maximum value.
  - So its the potential energy the other one.
  - Where is the energy of motion and the energy of potential equal?
  - What can you say about the whole energy thing?
  - So, you put the gear higher than nothing and put the skater on the ramp.
  - What brought the red?
  - Is that what it says?
  - Yes, I did.
  - What happens to the energies, and why?
  - But what a simulation.
  - Theres something in that bag.
  - I was thinking of doing some great simulation.
  - I dont think we should have a simulation somewhere specifically.
  - But can we use the...
  - Heres the thing. Put it on the side.
  - Well, thats the simulation that was...
  - Oh, yeah, yeah.
  - Was there anything else in that bag?
  - Theres postcards, tennis ball, ping-pong ball, and a canoe.
  - Yeah, I know.
  - But can we use it... if its really here?
  - Its not about getting in the piss.
  - Im not.
  - Whether its somewhere over there
  - Im fine.
  - Im not going to...
  - Instructions wherein the introduction is broken down
  - Im just wondering where the introduction is, where the...
  - Lets see where the lead is.
  - I guess you can ask him, maybe he knows.
  - Im not.
  - Simulation, yes, but wheres the simulation?
  - Im not going to be here.
  - Its okay, right here.
  - Put it on the handle. No.
  - Thats right.
  - Theres nothing there.
  - ♪ Thats where it is ♪
  - Its the bitterness.
  - There you go.
  - Put the skater on the ramp.
  - Where?
  - Put the skater in the middle of it.
  - First, set a small value for the mass of the skater.
  - ♪ Im not gonna let you down ♪
  - change the type of appearance
  - Lets look through the thread.
  - Cat
  - What do you want?
  - It doesnt matter.
  - Lets go with that.
  - So lets put some small value and gradually raise it.
  - How about a skateboard?
  - Okay, first point, how does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - Yeah, next, what can you say about the total energy?
  - Yeah, how did they talk to that Earth?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - So, could it be that... what was that origin of us?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - How does the speed of the skater change, and why?
  - Heres why.
  - Keep it sharp in the regulations at all?
  - You can pick something more regular for the skater.
  - Check the potential energy and the magnitude of the kinetic energy at various
    points below, above, in the middle of the ramp.
  - You can use pauses to make it easier to observe.
  - Find the point where the potential energy reaches its maximum value.
  - Where do we get to see it?
  - What? - What?
  - I mean, its really supposed to be in the visor when the calculator is counting
    down that energy.
  - Can you do that with the energy savings plus on the left over there?
  - Ah, thats what it looks like.
  - Whats the blue one?
  - Like what it really says.
  - The power is green, the blue is...
  - Is there a blue potential energy?
  - Im sure it is because... it has to be because if the potential energy...
  - So look for the point where the potential energy reaches the maximum value.
  - Would it have blue potential?
  - I know.
  - So, the whole energy would be green?
  - Second question Find out when the kinetic energy reaches its maximum value.
  - Is this green business energy?
  - Whats the thing that doesnt do anything?
  - Thats the third one.
  - The heat generator.
  - Find out if the kinetic energy and the potential energy are equal
  - So you have to put a nut on the hammer.
  - Oh, is that right?
  - Yes, I did.
  - But the task itself has been to keep the mass the same.
  - Thats the way it should be.
  - Well, then, Ill have to put some knives on.
  - What happens to the skater?
  - And you put two-thirds of that energy into it.
  - Oh, my God.
  - What happens to the energy, and why?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - What happened to the total energy?
  - ...youre trying to hide the links and the various parts.
  - Yeah, but I dont think we need to.
  - I mean, thats it.
  - Wait, not me.
  - I know.
  - Im not going to.
  - Slide it down.
  - This must be the...
  - ...a simulator.
  - I know.
  - The beginning.
  - Do you want me to take this now?
  - Yeah, it said that the introduction was the first.
  - And get to know them.
  - Put it on the handle.
  - No, not at all.
  - Thats it.
  - And get the skater on the ramp.
  - Then there was the skater who was massaging...
  - ...a little bit of value.
  - Whats in it now?
  - Okay, how does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - How does the speed of a skater change, and why?
  - How does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - I have to answer.
  - Can we see any energy from here?
  - Im sure you do.
  - What?
  - Ill see you around.
  - This is the point that we can.
  - Im going to ask.
  - You can also change that character if you want a cat or a dog, for example.
  - Hey, whats up?
  - Do you dare to?
  - Keep it sharp.
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Then theres the next thing, speed...
  - Howd you get the speed?
  - ...can it stay if you take it off and itll fly?
  - Whats that say when you press the button?
  - Its gonna go up and disappear up because theres that.
  - Yes, I did.
  - What what what?
  - Theres a speed, what does that mean?
  - Well see about that.
  - Speed changes, and why?
  - How does the speed of a skater change, and why?
  - Keep your eye on the regulations, no...
  - ...and pick something more regular for the skater.
  - Down, up, mid, study the magnitude of the potential energy and the kinetic energy...
  - ...the different points of the ramp, the lower, the upper, the middle...
  - ...youre going to use a pause to facilitate observation.
  - ...find a point where the potential energy reaches its maximum value.
  - Find the point where the kinetic energy reaches its maximum value.
  - Is there any way to get it chewed?
  - Ill at least slow it down.
  - Find a point where the kinetic energy and the potential energy are equal.
  - Thats it.
  - Put the foot higher than the...
  - ...and put the skater on the ramp.
  - Yeah, well, then what happens to the skateboarder is the first question.
  - What can you do?
  - ...what happens to energy and why?
  - And then the last one, what can you say about the total energy?
  - Then I guess the energy park brought it.
  - Okay, so thats the bottom line.
  - Put it on.
  - Just put it away.
  - So we have to be here.
  - The following measures
  - And the first one didn t have any.
  - The weight of the vehicle
  - A little bit of value in the mass.
  - I guess thats where the red dot needs to be watered.
  - Its under the skater.
  - Ah, yeah.
  - And then when you let go, I guess its yes.
  - Jeep
  - He was a scarecrow.
  - We need to raise the steps or degrees above that mass and see if thats okay how it works.
  - Cant you take that from the bottom?
  - Can that take time?
  - Two of them.
  - Can you do that?
  - This is just a brief introduction.
  - Youre not?
  - Whats this? Whats this?
  - Maybe were not gonna use it...
  - I know.
  - How does the mass of the skater affect the energy?
  - Then...
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - How does the speed of a skater change, and why? 
  - Thats it.
  - Thats it.
  - Keep it sharp in the regulation.
  - Not at all.
  - And pick something more regular for the skater.
  - Check the potential energy and traffic levels at different points on the ramp.
  - Can you use a break to facilitate observation?
  - Find him soon.
  - Find the point where the potential energy reaches the highest possible value.
  - Is that a measurement?
  - Lets just put a plus on that energy, shall we?
  - Where? - Where?
  - And down to that part of the scale, so we can get it.
  - Whats that energy up there?
  - Should I be watching them?
  - So theres a plus.
  - Yes, right here.
  - I did.
  - Yes, you are.
  - Yeah, thats good.
  - All right, look for the point where the potential energy reaches the highest possible value.
  - Put the grit higher than none and put the skater on the ramp.
  - ...a lot of it.
  - What is that?
  - What happens to energy, and why?
  - Wheres the introductory section?
  - Were gonna have to find some kind of simulation.
  - Thats the question here, too.
  - We can go to the menus in the introduction.
  - I wonder where they are.
  - I guess thats the simulation.
  - We have to do this kind of simulation and then we have to respond.
  - Is the pressure going to drop on this lead?
  - I know.
  - Its exciting.
  - What the hell?!
  - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
  - Dont make it bitter, is it?
  - I know.
  - Put the skater on the ramp.
  - Thats a long way off. I dont really drink a ton.
  - Will it stay there?
  - If I let go.
  - Let go of me.
  - It says, "First, set a small value for the mass of the skater, and then gradually increase it".
  - So we need to gradually raise it to its mass and see how it affects energy.
  - Im not going to.
  - So, I guess its obvious that its slowing down, accelerating?
  - Yes, I did.
  - Lets see that energy bar over there on the left.
  - Plus, you know.
  - So were going to get that green.
  - This?
  - I know.
  - Good afternoon.
  - But what does that say in that blue?
  - Yes, I did.
  - Is there any way to make this bigger?
  - Whats that, a green business?
  - Put that magnifying glass on.
  - Oh, my God.
  - Its not gonna help.
  - Well, someones reading all over there.
  - Can we ask that man what it says?
  - Whats on the blue paycheck?
  - I dont have enough eyesight, it starts with a "P".
  - Yeah, Im starting to.
  - You can buy a house.
  - I wonder if we could go closer and see.
  - I dont dare go in there in the middle of the lines.
  - Yes, you are.
  - Or can I go?
  - Do you want me to go see some of the drugs?
  - Lets ask him.
  - I guess now.
  - Its a robot thats talking to us.
  - Thats wonderful.
  - Write a ton.
  - Do I have to write it?
  - Do you want me to write a note here?
  - Or talk?
  - Put it in the window.
  - What does it say about the blue prize?
  - Oh, now its on the caps lock.
  - We cant see.
  - What? - What?
  - What?
  - What? - What?
  - What?
  - Im the one.
  - Fuck you.
  - The blue award says, "Im going to the ball".
  - Good. - Tell us what you got.
  - We cant see.
  - Ill see you later.
  - No, its going to get really dark.
  - How does mass affect energy?
  - What can you say about the total energy?
  - Is that a speed reading?
  - Its a speed reading here.
  - Or here.
  - Im not reading.
  - Whats that first part about?
  - Its got the energy of movement.
  - I dont see her either.
  - Whats that locked in?
  - I dont know. Im not sure.
  - So the next thing you know, what can you say about total energy?
  - But can you ask that guy?
  - Yeah, you can ask me.
  - What do you mean, ask?
  - Thats the way it is.
  - Keep your eyes open. Theres no...
  - Is there any speed anywhere?
  - Thats the way you see it, thats the way the duck is.
  - Pick a standard mass for the skater.
  - Dont touch that.
  - Mass. What?
  - So this...
  - Its probably that potential energy when it says here that youre exploring potential energy and
  - the magnitude of the movement energy at different points in the ramp, below, above, in the middle.
  - You can use a break.
  - Find the point where the potential energy reaches its maximum value. 
  - Find the point where the movement energy reaches...
  - But next, you have to find one where theyre as big as you, so you can look at it.
  - Put the bitter one higher than none.
  - Wait, its going to bite.
